> [!info] I am not an analytical philosopher.
> I'm good at understanding philosophical writings on an intuitive level.  I just get it, and can connect it to real life stuff with ease.  But breaking down the arguments and analyzing them is tedious to me.  
> Which means it's a skill that I need to improve.  
> In Fall 2024, I took a Social & Political Philosophy class with a professor who gave me really useful feedback.  During the break between Fall 2024 and Winter 2025 semesters, I'm going to focus on skills drills to improve my analytical skills.  
> To that end, I had ChatGPT develop a three-week self-study curriculum for improving those skills since I'm taking a Metaphysics class with the same professor in Winter 2025 semester.
> It's rigorous.  Three passages per week to read and analyze.  Because I'm taking a Metaphysics class next semester, it selected passages based on that, which will give me a good prep for the work in that upcoming class.
> ChatGPT isn't always consistent in its output, but that doesn't make it worthless.  It gives me structures to work with, and points me to resources that I might not have discovered on my own.  We don't know what we don't know.  We often don't even know what questions to ask.  The LLM bots are like a GUI to access the collective knowledge of humanity, in a very personalized way.  My favorite use of it is to generate learning plans that I can follow at my own pace, and that I can adjust as I go because my curiosity takes me where it will.

## **1. Define Philosophical Analysis**

Philosophical analysis focuses on breaking down arguments, concepts, and assumptions to examine their meaning, structure, and implications. At its core, it asks:

- **What is the argument trying to say?** (Clarification)
- **How does the argument work?** (Logical structure)
- **Is the argument strong or weak? Why?** (Evaluation)

---

## **2. Practical Exercises to Build Analysis Skills**

### **A. Choose Short Passages for Practice**

Start with small sections of texts you’re familiar with, such as _On Liberty_ or _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_. Alternatively, use metaphysics texts or questions to prepare for next semester. Some examples:

- _What is substance?_ (Spinoza, Aristotle)
- _Is time real or merely a concept?_ (Kant, McTaggart)

### **B. Break Down the Passage in Steps**

For each passage or idea, answer the following:

1. **What does it mean?**
    - Paraphrase it in your own words. Be precise and concise.
2. **What are the key claims or assumptions?**
    - Identify hidden premises and assumptions in the argument.
3. **How is the argument structured?**
    - Break it into premises and conclusions. Is it deductive? Inductive? Analogical?
4. **What are the strengths and weaknesses?**
    - Analyze its validity, soundness, or gaps in reasoning. Does it rely on questionable assumptions?
5. **What objections or counterexamples could challenge it?**
    - Consider alternative viewpoints or hypothetical cases.

---

## **3. Write Mini-Analyses to Practice**

- Take a **single claim** from a philosopher and write a short, 300-word analysis following the above steps.
- Example prompt: _“Mill argues that individuals know themselves better than the state does. Is this always true? Are there exceptions?”_

You can also use classic metaphysics questions:

- _Does the mind exist independently of the body?_
- _What is the nature of identity over time?_

---

## **4. Compare Your Work to Examples of Strong Analysis**

- Look at **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** or other academic articles for examples of rigorous analysis.
- Observe how authors identify assumptions, critique arguments, and explore implications.

---

## **5. Reflect on Your Previous Papers**

Take one of the papers you submitted this semester and rewrite a section to include deeper analysis.

- Where could you have identified an assumption?
- Could you have explored objections or counterarguments more?
- How might you strengthen your evaluation of a thinker’s argument?

---

## **6. Build the Habit of Asking Key Questions**

To train your brain for deeper analysis, keep these questions handy as you read or write:

- **Clarification:**
    - What does the author mean? Are there ambiguous terms?
- **Strength of Argument:**
    - Are the premises true? Does the conclusion logically follow?
- **Evaluation:**
    - Does this argument align with lived experience?
    - What counterarguments might challenge it?
    - Why does this matter?

---

## **7. Supplement with Resources**

- **Books:**
    
    - _How to Read a Book_ by Mortimer Adler (for close reading strategies).
    - _A Rulebook for Arguments_ by Anthony Weston (on clear argumentation).
    - _The Philosopher’s Toolkit_ by Julian Baggini and Peter S. Fosl.
- **Videos/Podcasts:**
    
    - Look for philosophy lectures on YouTube (Harvard, Yale, etc.).
    - Listen to podcasts like _Philosophize This!_ and pause episodes to reflect critically on their arguments.

---

## **8. Plan Your Practice**

- **Week 1:** Focus on short passages and paraphrasing key arguments.
- **Week 2:** Write mini-analyses and explore counterarguments.
- **Week 3:** Rewrite sections of old papers, compare your analyses to examples, and reflect on growth.


---

## **Week 1: Focus on Paraphrasing and Identifying Claims**

### **Passage 1: Aristotle – On Substance**

_"Substance, in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the word, is that which is neither predicated of a subject nor present in a subject; for instance, the individual man or horse."_  
— _Metaphysics, Book Zeta_

#### **Prompt**

1. Paraphrase Aristotle’s definition of substance in your own words.
2. Identify his **key claim**: What makes substance “primary”?
3. Can you think of modern examples that might challenge Aristotle’s definition? For example: Could software or data be considered substances?

---

### **Passage 2: Descartes – On the Mind and Body**

_"I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is, a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason—words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant. Yet I am a true thing, and truly existing; but what kind of a thing? I have said it already: a thinking thing."_  
— _Meditations on First Philosophy_

#### **Prompt**

1. Paraphrase Descartes’s argument for the self as a “thinking thing.”
2. What **assumptions** is Descartes making about the nature of identity and existence?
3. What objections might arise? For instance, is it possible to exist _without_ thinking?

---

### **Passage 3: Leibniz – Identity of Indiscernibles**

_"There cannot be two substances that are perfectly alike, differing only in number."_  
— _Discourse on Metaphysics_

#### **Prompt**

1. Paraphrase Leibniz’s claim about identity in your own words.
2. What **premises** or assumptions does this claim rely on?
3. Can you think of counterexamples? Consider quantum particles or identical twins: Does Leibniz’s argument still hold?

---

## **Week 2: Analyzing Structure and Weaknesses**

### **Passage 4: Kant – On Space and Time**

_"Space is not an empirical concept that has been derived from external experiences. [...] It is a necessary representation, a priori, which underlies all external intuitions."_  
— _Critique of Pure Reason_

#### **Prompt**

1. Outline Kant’s argument in steps:
    - **Premises:** What is he claiming about space as “a priori”?
    - **Conclusion:** Why is space not derived from experience?
2. Identify the **strengths** of Kant’s reasoning. Does it account for the universality of spatial perception?
3. Critique: How would a modern empiricist or neuroscientist respond to Kant’s claim?

---

### **Passage 5: Spinoza – Substance Monism**

_"Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God."_  
— _Ethics, Part I_

#### **Prompt**

1. Restate Spinoza’s claim: What does it mean for everything to be “in God”?
2. Break down the **logical structure**: What premises lead Spinoza to substance monism?
3. Evaluate: Does Spinoza’s idea leave room for individual agency or free will?

---

### **Passage 6: Hume – On Causation**

_"All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the relation of Cause and Effect. [...] But our idea of this relation is deriv’d entirely from experience, when we find that particular objects are constantly conjoin’d with each other."_  
— _An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_

#### **Prompt**

1. Clarify Hume’s critique of causation in your own words.
2. Analyze the **assumptions**: What role does experience play in establishing causal relations?
3. Challenge Hume: Are there counterexamples where causality seems intuitive (e.g., natural laws)?

---

## **Week 3: Full Mini-Analyses and Counterarguments**

### **Passage 7: McTaggart – The Unreality of Time**

_"If we consider the A series—the series of past, present, and future—time involves a contradiction. The distinctions of past, present, and future are essential to time, but each event must have all three characteristics, which is impossible."_  
— _The Unreality of Time_

#### **Prompt**

1. Restate McTaggart’s argument for why time is “unreal.”
2. Analyze the logic:
    - What is the **contradiction** McTaggart claims exists?
    - How does he conclude that time cannot exist?
3. Evaluate:
    - Is McTaggart’s argument compelling?
    - Consider alternative conceptions of time, such as the B-theory (time as a series of relations).

---

### **Passage 8: Sartre – Existence Precedes Essence**

_"Man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards."_  
— _Existentialism is a Humanism_

#### **Prompt**

1. Paraphrase Sartre’s claim about existence and essence.
2. What are the **implications** of this idea for human freedom and responsibility?
3. Critique: How would a determinist challenge Sartre’s view?

---

### **Passage 9: Parfit – On Personal Identity**

_"It is not true that our continued existence always matters. What does matter is not identity, but psychological connectedness."_  
— _Reasons and Persons_

#### **Prompt**

1. Explain Parfit’s claim about identity and psychological connectedness.
2. Break down the argument:
    - How does Parfit redefine what “matters” for personal identity?
3. Explore objections: Does Parfit’s argument conflict with everyday intuitions about selfhood and continuity?

---

## **Suggestions for Completing the Prompts**

- Aim for **1-2 mini-analyses per week**, building up from focused paraphrasing to deeper critiques.
- Compare your work to resources like the **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** or secondary commentaries on the thinkers.
- For any confusing sections, jot down questions or write out where you get stuck—this trains deeper engagement.
