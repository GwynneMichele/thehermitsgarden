I sometimes joke that I have an ego the size of Texas, and that's humble of me to say so, because really, it's the size of the Universe itself.  So one of the "virtues" I have chosen to work on in my life is [[Intellectual Humility\|Intellectual Humility]].

I don't know what I don't know.

The more I learn, the more I realize how much I still have to learn.

My life is literally dedicated to learning everything that I can learn.

And as time goes on, my awareness of how much I can never know expands.

It's a paradox of knowledge.

The more you know, the more you don't.
