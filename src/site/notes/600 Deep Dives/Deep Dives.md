The list above is my currently active Deep Dives.

A Deep Dive is just like it sounds. 

A topic where I'm going deep.

Sometimes, it's structured as a school-like curriculum because that structure gives me a concrete path to follow on something I want to improve, but don't necessarily want to go to school for.

Like, I want to improve my writing skills, so I had [[200 Research Resources/220 Random Atomic Notes/ChatGPT\|ChatGPT]] draft a DIY MFA in Creative Writing for me with suggested reading pairing craft books by authors with a piece of fiction written by those authors so I can see how they put their own advice to work - or not.

Curious Dialogues came about after the election when I was lamenting to ChatGPT about how much lack of critical thinking affected the election - searches for "can I change my vote" spiked after the "what is a tariff" searches spiked.

One of the authors suggested by the bot was [[200 Research Resources/220 Random Atomic Notes/Paulo Freire\|Paulo Freire]], specifically his book [[200 Research Resources/240 Book Notes/Pedagogy of the Oppressed - Paulo Freire\|Pedagogy of the Oppressed]].  

I looked it up, started reading it, found it really good, and then was also inspired to start a sort of meta-dialogue project pairing liberatory thinkers with conservative thinkers and seeing how their ideas contrast, where they overlap, and see what themes develop and what ideas are sparked.

Deep Dives are things I aim to spend at least a year diving into, exploring from a variety angles, and generating lots more questions about.
