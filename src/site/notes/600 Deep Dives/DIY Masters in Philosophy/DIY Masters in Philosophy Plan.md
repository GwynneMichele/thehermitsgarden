*I ranted a bit to ChatGPT about how all the "old dead dudes" we study in philosophy were so very wrong about so much stuff, and it annoys me that we're still so reliant on them instead of undertaking a revision of the Western canon of philosophy.  Then I had it draft my a DIY Masters in Philosophy.  This is a go-at-your-own-pace sort of program.  No actual degree, but **loads** of content potential that will likely be useful as I push forward in my actual degree plans.* 

*I always get really great reading lists from these self-study curricula that I have ChatGPT create for me.*

**DIY Master's in Philosophy**, built around the framework of critiquing, reorganizing, and expanding beyond the traditional Western canon. The idea is to immerse yourself in a mix of classical philosophy, contemporary thought, marginalized voices, and interdisciplinary perspectives to develop a rich, multifaceted understanding of philosophy today. The structure is flexible, but I’ll break it down into **five core modules** and a **final thesis project**, which would mirror a typical master's program but with your own, self-directed focus.

### **Module 1: Deconstructing the Canon**  
The goal here is to engage critically with the traditional Western canon. Understand it, but don't accept it uncritically. Break it apart and find where it falters.

#### **Key Readings**:
- Plato, *The Republic*  
- Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*  
- René Descartes, *Meditations on First Philosophy*  
- John Locke, *Second Treatise of Government*  
- Immanuel Kant, *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*  
- G.W.F. Hegel, *Phenomenology of Spirit*  
- Friedrich Nietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil*  

#### **Supplementary Resources**:
- Susan Neiman, *Evil in Modern Thought* (to see how modern thinkers wrestle with old problems).
- Catherine Wilson, *How to Be an Epicurean* (to get a view of how ancient ideas still resonate today).

#### **Reflection Exercise**:
Write short essays on *where* and *how* each of these thinkers failed in their assumptions about human nature, society, or ethics. Consider what each missed about gender, race, power, science, or social structures that we now understand better.

### **Module 2: Voices from the Margins**  
Move beyond the Western canon to explore feminist, decolonial, queer, and intersectional perspectives that challenge and expand traditional philosophical ideas.

#### **Key Readings**:
- Simone de Beauvoir, *The Second Sex*  
- Audre Lorde, *Sister Outsider*  
- bell hooks, *Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center*  
- Frantz Fanon, *Black Skin, White Masks*  
- Sylvia Wynter, *Unsettling the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom*  
- Kimberlé Crenshaw, *On Intersectionality*  
- Judith Butler, *Gender Trouble*  
- María Lugones, *Coloniality of Gender*  

#### **Supplementary Resources**:
- Sara Ahmed, *The Cultural Politics of Emotion*  
- Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, *Can the Subaltern Speak?*  
- Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, *Epistemology of the Closet*  

#### **Reflection Exercise**:
Analyze how each of these thinkers reframes issues like identity, power, and oppression. How do their views challenge the core ideas of the philosophers you read in Module 1? Develop a response paper titled: *What Philosophy Looks Like From the Margins*.

---

### **Module 3: Philosophy in a Global Context**  
Look at how philosophical traditions outside the Western canon can inform a more holistic understanding of the world.

#### **Key Readings**:
- Laozi, *Tao Te Ching*  
- Confucius, *The Analects*  
- Nagarjuna, *The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way*  
- Kwame Gyekye, *African Cultural Values*  
- Aníbal Quijano, *Coloniality of Power*  
- Vine Deloria Jr., *God Is Red*  
- Raimon Panikkar, *The Cosmotheandric Experience*  

#### **Supplementary Resources**:
- Homi K. Bhabha, *The Location of Culture*  
- Ashis Nandy, *The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism*  
- Enrique Dussel, *Ethics of Liberation in the Age of Globalization and Exclusion*  

#### **Reflection Exercise**:
Write a comparative essay titled: *The Limits of the Western Canon: Insights from Non-Western Philosophies*. What do Taoism, Buddhism, or Indigenous philosophies offer that Western philosophy often overlooks?

---

### **Module 4: Philosophy of Science and the Future of Thought**  
Rebuild the foundations by integrating modern science, technology, and posthumanist theories into philosophical inquiry.

#### **Key Readings**:
- Thomas Kuhn, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*  
- Donna Haraway, *A Cyborg Manifesto*  
- Bruno Latour, *We Have Never Been Modern*

- Timothy Morton, *Hyperobjects*  

#### **Supplementary Resources**:
- Andy Clark, *Natural-Born Cyborgs*  
- Francisco Varela, *The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience*  
- Nick Bostrom, *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies*  

#### **Reflection Exercise**:
Critique mind-body dualism and other metaphysical relics in light of contemporary science. Write an essay exploring the question: *What Is Consciousness in the 21st Century?*

---

### **Module 5: Ethics, Justice, and Liberation**  
Recenter philosophy around the practical issues of ethics, justice, and liberation that matter most in today’s world.

#### **Key Readings**:
- Iris Marion Young, *Justice and the Politics of Difference*  
- Paulo Freire, *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*

- Nancy Fraser, *Redistribution or Recognition?*  
- Achille Mbembe, *Necropolitics*  

#### **Reflection Exercise**:
Develop a theory of justice based on these readings that could address the systemic inequalities present today. Draft a paper titled: *Justice Beyond the Western Paradigm*.

---

### **Final Project: Reorganizing the Canon**
Now that you’ve critiqued the traditional canon, explored marginalized voices, and integrated modern and global perspectives, the final project is to **rebuild** the canon. How would you structure philosophy if you were in charge of the curriculum? What voices and ideas would take precedence?

#### **Thesis Proposal**:
- Write a detailed proposal for a **new canon of philosophy**.
  - What thinkers are essential?
  - What philosophical problems should be prioritized?
  - How should philosophy be taught to reflect the world we live in today?
  - How do we center marginalized voices in philosophical discourse?

#### **Final Deliverable**:
- A written thesis (about 10,000–15,000 words) that lays out your vision of philosophy, its purpose, and how it should evolve for the 21st century and beyond.

---

### **Additional Resources for Ongoing Study**:
- **Podcasts**: *Philosophize This!*, *The Partially Examined Life*, *Overthink*.
- **Online Lecture Series**: Look for philosophy lectures from Yale Open Courses, MIT OpenCourseWare, or Coursera.
- **Discussion Communities**: Join philosophy groups on Reddit or engage with philosophical thinkers on platforms like Farcaster, where you’re already building an audience.
- **Writing**: Regularly blog or write about your reflections, critiques, and insights. Consider publishing on platforms like Medium, Substack, or even an academic journal if you’re so inclined.

This program can be tailored as you go along, but the key is to create a dialogue between the old and the new, the canon and the marginalized, the philosophical and the scientific. The ultimate goal is to come out of this with a deep, well-rounded understanding of philosophy—one that you’ve shaped on your own terms.
