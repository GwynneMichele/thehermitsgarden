I'm a writer.

I'm a very good writer.

But I want to get better.

So I asked ChatGPT to draft a "DIY MFA in Creative Writing" for me.  

And this is the result.

So why DIY and not actually get an MFA degree?

Well, for one thing, I'm in school full-time finishing up my bachelor's in philosophy after a two-decade pause.  I *might* get an MFA, but I'm considering other graduate degrees as well.  

And that's still two years away.

I want to improve my writing now.

Because ChatGPT has persistent memory features - it remembers various things you tell it and draws on past conversations you've had with it - it was able to suggest materials that are aligned with my personal interests and goals.

For instance, it knows I'm an Anarchist, so first on the list of readings is [[600 Deep Dives/DIY MFA Creative Writing/Steering the Craft/Steering the Craft\|Steering the Craft]] by Ursula K. Le Guin, a small book dedicated to the technical aspects of the craft. There are 10 chapters, each with an exercise to complete, and as I go through them, I'll be sharing them right here.

I'll also be reading the [[Dispossessed\|Dispossessed]], also by Le Guin, one of her many works of fiction, suggested by ChatGPT based on my interests.  

That's the pattern this "DIY MFA" will follow.

Read a craft book along with a piece of fiction by the author of the craft book.  Do the suggested exercises in the craft book, reflect on the practices, review the fiction with an analytical eye, and see how my writing improves.

I'll also be doing other exercises - for instance, one of my first "assignments" is a detailed character study.  I'll be sharing all of these as I go.  

This will also help me build up a portfolio - and the DIY MFA plan does include crafting and submitting pieces for publication as well as more learning about the business aspects of building a successful career as an eclectic writer.

The plan is subject to change over time, and I'll update as I go!

I will be updating this regularly, so check-in frequently!  I'll be figuring out some way for y'all to be able to share comments as I go!

Also, feel free to adapt the idea for yourself!  I *love* using ChatGPT to create learning plans for myself, and was doing so for a year before I went back to college!  Turned out to be great practice for something I didn't know I was going to do when I first started creating self-study curricula with the bot's assistance.
