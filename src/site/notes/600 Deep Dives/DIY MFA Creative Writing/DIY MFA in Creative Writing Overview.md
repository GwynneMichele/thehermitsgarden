### **Your DIY MFA Core Structure**

#### 1. **Foundations of Craft**

- _Goal_: Strengthen your technical writing skills and understanding of various genres, forms, and literary techniques.
- **Reading List**:
    - **Fiction**: _Story_ by Robert McKee (narrative structure), _The Elements of Style_ by Strunk & White (grammar/style basics), and _The Art of Fiction_ by John Gardner (techniques for fiction writers).
    - **Nonfiction & Memoir**: _On Writing_ by Stephen King, _The Art of Memoir_ by Mary Karr.
    - **Poetry**: _The Poet’s Companion_ by Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux, _The Triggering Town_ by Richard Hugo.
    - **Screenwriting** (optional if you explore this): _Save the Cat!_ by Blake Snyder.
- **Writing Exercises**:
    - Write 500-word vignettes that focus on a single aspect of craft: dialogue, setting, character voice, etc.
    - Genre-hopping: Write microfiction or flash pieces in genres you don’t normally explore (e.g., horror, romance, sci-fi).
- **Application**: Incorporate these exercises into your short fiction or microfiction projects to build momentum and versatility in style.

#### 2. **Reading as a Writer**

- _Goal_: Read widely and critically, building your reading list around authors and genres you admire and wish to emulate.
- **Develop a Personal Reading List**:
    - Focus on **solarpunk**, mythologized futures, and anarchist literature (Ba Jin, Ursula K. Le Guin, Octavia Butler).
    - Revisit classics with a critical eye, studying structure and technique. Focus on **experimental narratives** (e.g., Italo Calvino’s _Invisible Cities_, David Mitchell’s _Cloud Atlas_).
- **Critical Reading Journals**:
    - After each book, write a 500-1000 word analysis of the writing techniques, focusing on what you can take away for your own work.
    - Use these journals as **reflective prompts** in your writing process (e.g., How can I adapt Le Guin's world-building strategies for my solarpunk mythologies?).

#### 3. **Specialized Studies**

- _Goal_: Dive deep into your particular areas of interest, aligning with your themes of identity, solo living, queer heresy, slow living, etc.
- **Microfiction & Solarpunk Mythologies**:
    - Explore how microfiction can reflect myth-making. Write daily micro-stories that reimagine mythologies through a solarpunk lens. Use these as building blocks for future larger projects.
    - Consider world-building exercises from RPG frameworks like **Thousand-Year-Old Vampire** and adapt them to a writing format (use this for both plot and character development).
- **Creative Nonfiction**:
    - Develop essays blending philosophy and memoir. Your work on **The Curious Hermit** could form the basis of a longer essay collection, blending personal narrative with social critique.
    - Read essays from writers like **Rebecca Solnit** and **Zadie Smith** to analyze how they blend personal narrative with larger social and political themes.
- **Writing Ritual**:
    - Incorporate your daily focus words (Identity, Service, Consistency, etc.) into creative prompts. Each day, use your word as a **thematic seed** for journaling or flash fiction.
- **Experiments in Form**:
    - Play with nonlinear structures, fractured timelines, or alternative storytelling methods (e.g., multimedia fiction, writing in fragments, hybrid forms of poetry and prose).
    - Consider incorporating **code** and **data** into your creative practice, such as using coding to generate text-based art or interactive fiction.

#### 4. **The Business of Writing**

- _Goal_: Build a career strategy around your creative practice, from growing your audience to mastering the submission process.
- **Building Your Platform**:
    - Focus on **Farcaster** and other decentralized platforms where you’re already cultivating a following. Engage your audience through serial fiction projects, experimental writing, and microfiction.
    - Start building a **newsletter** around your solarpunk mythology world—perhaps sharing world-building notes, short stories, or philosophical reflections.
- **Submission Practice**:
    - Create a **submission spreadsheet** to track calls for short story collections, microfiction anthologies, solarpunk-themed magazines, etc.
    - Submit to a set number of magazines, contests, or anthologies each month (e.g., aiming for 5-10 submissions). Focus on both **mainstream** and **niche** publications.
    - Develop a **pitch** for essays and personal narratives—could start with philosophy-oriented publications or those interested in queer, slow-living themes.
- **Self-Publishing**:
    - Explore publishing a **microfiction collection** on a platform like **Gumroad** or **Patreon** as a way to monetize your smaller works while continuing larger projects.

#### 5. **Capstone Project: A Master Work**

- _Goal_: Complete a major creative project as a demonstration of everything you’ve learned in the DIY MFA.
- **Major Project Options**:
    - **Novella or Novel**: Craft a longer solarpunk mythology work, where you combine speculative elements with a slow-living narrative framework.
    - **Essay Collection**: Expand on your philosophical and spiritual explorations, creating a reflective series that explores themes of queer heresy, solo living, and the divine as paradox.
    - **Microfiction Anthology**: Curate your weekly microfiction into a **thematic collection**, organized around a narrative arc or concept.
- **Workshops & Feedback**:
    - Develop a **peer group** (online or in person) where you can workshop drafts of your capstone work.
    - Alternatively, create a **community-based writing challenge** (perhaps on Farcaster), where participants can share writing based on the same solarpunk or anarchist themes you’re working with.

#### 6. **Optional Courses**

- _Goal_: Supplement your main curriculum with flexible, interest-driven projects.
- **Translation**: Study **translated works**, particularly ancient Chinese texts or anarchist literature, and explore translation as a creative practice. Try translating poetry or flash fiction from Mandarin (or another language you’re studying).
- **Digital Storytelling**: Learn about interactive or **transmedia storytelling**, experimenting with combining written work with visual media or even coding interactive fiction.
- **Workshops & Masterclasses**: Take online workshops from platforms like **Coursera**, **MasterClass**, or even **local writing centers** for more interactive engagement.

### **Graduation: Assessing Your Progress**

- **Portfolio**: By the end of this DIY MFA, you should have a robust portfolio that includes:
    - A collection of short stories, microfiction, or essays.
    - A major completed project (novel, essay collection, etc.).
    - A clear platform strategy (blog, newsletter, social media presence).
    - Submission history or self-published works.
- **Reflection**: Use your focus words to journal throughout this DIY MFA process. Reflect regularly on your progress, noting how your **identity** as a writer evolves with each new milestone.
