Part 1: *"I want you to write for pleasure - for play"* - Ursula K. Le Guin in [[600 Deep Dives/DIY MFA Creative Writing/Steering the Craft/Steering the Craft\|Steering the Craft]]

[[900 Admin Files/901 Periodic Notes/1 Daily Notes/Friday 10-25-2024\|Friday 10-25-2024]] - I've been struggling with this prompt for several days now.  And I just figured out why.  It's because this is how I already write.  The prompt is about playing with the sound of the writes.  Write something meant to be read out loud.

But that's how I *already* write.  The words are flowing *loudly* through my head and it's all I can do for my fingers to keep up with writing them.  And I am a .fast. typist BTW.  Was a professional transcriptionist for a decade, top speed 130 words per minute.

My fingers fly over the keyboard.  

People actually love to watch me type because of it.

Tap tap tap tap tap.  

The rhythm of the words.

Sound.  Sound is so important to those who can hear it.

And perhaps even more so to those who can't.

How much do people spend on mechanical keyboards to get just.the.right.sound???
