# Some Rambling Thoughts To Be Revisited From Time To Time
One of my favorite things about reading philosophy - and other topics - is those moments where something I've experience or puzzled out myself gets put into words by another.

I learned about the concept of [[Hermeneutic Injustice\|Hermeneutic Injustice]] in a Disability Studies philosophy class.  This is the idea that because we can't express our experience until we have the words to label our experience, we cannot fully communicate with others, or with ourselves.  This is why getting that [[Autism\|Autism]] or [[900 Admin Files/990 Old Vaults/The Tome/90 Attachments and Resources/98 Definition Notes/ADHD\|ADHD]] diagnosis is so very important for so many people.  Having a [[label\|label]] contextualizes our experience - we're no longer alone in our "weirdness," there are others like us, who have similar experience, and who we can relate to.

I'm reading Marx for a political philosophy class I'm taking this semester.  He gave us a way to describe and critique the phenomena under [[900 Admin Files/990 Old Vaults/The Tome/90 Attachments and Resources/98 Definition Notes/Capitalism\|Capitalism]] where our labor is exploited and we are thus alienated from what makes us human - producing to meet our individual and collective needs.

The core connecting these various experiences is awareness.

If you don't have the words to describe something, you may not even be aware there's something  to describe.

And once you're aware, it's hard to forget.

[[Critical Race Theory\|Critical Race Theory]] is a label that will send certain conservatives into an absolute tizzy.

Some of it is, of course, that critical theory of any kind tends to pick apart the traditions that conservatives are so fond of trying to preserve, regardless of the actual human cost.

But I think, perhaps, some of it is because White Supremacist culture has turned the word "critical" into a painful word.

Authoritarians don't critique, they criticize.
It is not constructive criticism, but destructive.

The criticisms made by the authoritarian parent are aimed at shaming the child into conforming with their ideals of behavior.  It's not an attempt to guide the child towards personal improvement, but to force them into submission to authority.

So for the conservatives who are still most deeply entrenched in White Supremacist culture, without even an awareness of their indoctrination, the words "critical race theory" trigger a fight/flight response, rooted in that shame they feel at any sort of critique, because that shame-based criticism is the only sort that they know.

They can't even conceive of "critical consciousness", let alone that it's about developing a mindset that questions everything - questioning is barely tolerated under the authoritarian structures.  The  crushing of curiosity is the first direct oppression we suffer as children in Western society.  Some of us get lucky, find people who encourage us, but most people have the "Why?" stamped out of them early on.

My intelligence was identified very early on - I started reading at 2, and when my mother noticed I was following along with words as she read them, she started creating picture books using polaroids of everyday objects and the people I knew, with the words for those written on sharpie on the white part.  My grandfather kept a personal library with hundreds of books that I had access to whenever I visited, and my parents let me go to the library as much as I wanted, so I was constantly reading.

It wasn't until college that I discovered a love of philosophy -  I'd been more into science, math, and fiction writing prior to that.  The first time I tried college, I went for chemistry, with a plan to become a high school chemistry teacher.  I'm glad that didn't work out.

The second time I went to college, in my early 20s, I decided to major in philosophy.  I got about halfway through my degree and then life got all wonky on me, and what was supposed to be just a semester off turned out to be almost two decades, but I'm back at it now, a junior, with just a couple more philosophy classes to take and a crapton of non-philosophy gen ed classes to take over the next couple years to get that degree.

But it's not like I wasn't engaging with philosophy in the intervening time.

I discovered Stoicism years before the brodude anti-woke "philosophers" discovered it and diluted it down whatever nonsense it's become the last few years.

Stoicism, like other philosophies, wasn't just a head game a bunch of dudes played with each other in an ancient plaza, it was a practice.

"[[600 Deep Dives/Contemplative Philosophy/How Do I Live A Good Life\|How do I live a good life]]?" is the core question driving all of that, and ultimately what we're all trying to figure out.

When you start to ask that question, all sorts of other questions arise from that, so of course, it behooves authoritarian systems to condition people not to question anything at all.

Make philosophy seem lofty and out-of-touch so only those whose curiosity couldn't be stamped out pursue it.

Keep people from being able to identify their life conditions, and you keep them alienated and participating in the numbing of consumer culture.
