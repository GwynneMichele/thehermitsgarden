#### 3. **Practical Applications**

- Identify how each philosopher’s ideas can be applied to modern life (e.g., Stoicism in navigating social media).

#### Tools

- Use Zotero for bibliography management.
- Organize notes in Obsidian using linked atomic notes for ideas and themes.

### **Phase 3: Writing and Content Creation**

#### 1. **Format Ideas**

- **Essays**: Deep dives into specific philosophers or themes.
- **Reflections**: Personal insights on applying their ideas to daily life.

- Publish weekly: essays, shorter reflections, social media teasers, and a podcast.

---

### **Phase 4: Engagement and Reflection**

#### 1. **Encourage Dialogue**

- Host discussions on Farcaster, Bluesky, or other platforms.
- Create open threads inviting feedback and perspectives on each philosopher.

#### 2. **Reflect and Refine**

- Revisit completed essays and episodes for synthesis.
- Look for overarching patterns or new themes to explore.

#### 3. **Gather Material for a Larger Project**

- Use the series as a foundation for a future book, digital course, or workshop series.

### **Timeline**

1. **Month 1:** Preliminary research and content creation for the first philosopher (e.g., Aristotle).
2. **Month 2:** Publish and engage while researching the next philosopher (e.g., Laozi).
3. **Months 3-12:** Repeat, with regular check-ins to reflect on the series’ direction and impact.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. Identify the first philosopher to focus on.
2. Draft a detailed outline for their feature (e.g., key ideas, practical applications, contemporary relevance).
3. Begin research and start taking notes in Obsidian.
