Right now, as I write this, it's the evening of November 6th, 2024.

Trump won the election.

I don't think this is a good thing, but I don't think we're quite as doomed as some thing.

It's gonna be bad for a lot of people, good for others, and the world is going to change a lot in ways we can't predict.

But I'm gonna do what I do - keep learning.

Enter this new content series - a learn and create in public series - where I'm going to explore contrasting thinkers, sharing my resources and notes here in this digital garden as I go, and then creating more refined content in the form of essays I'll publish on Paragraph and Substack, and podcasts that will include both human and AI-generated segments - [[NotebookLM\|NotebookLM]] is GREAT for loading up to 50 resources and then having it generate a podcast-like audio that has a male voice and female voice engaging in a conversation about the subject.

I'm starting with contrasting [[Paolo Freire\|Paolo Freire]]'s views on liberatory education and critical consciousness to transform self and society with [[Edmund Burke\|Edmund Burke]]'s conservative traditionalism that was skeptical of deliberate efforts to initiate any sort of change in society, and that gets to the roots of the ideological divide between left and right.  Check out the [[600 Deep Dives/Curious Dialogues/Freire and Burke/Freire and Burke Reading List\|Freire and Burke Reading List]] I had ChatGPT draft for me, focused on stuff that I'd be able to source through the school library and all the databases I have access to as a student.

I want to understand better where conservative thinking comes from, the logic that they're basing their decisions on, and how to better counter it, and also create content that brings leftist ideas to a level where you don't need to look up a dozen words every page because not everyone gets off on that like we philosophy nerds do.

Going back to college is helping me to refine my thinking and writing, but it's not covering the topics I want to cover.

So I'll take the skills I'm learning and apply them to where my own curiosity leads.

First up is [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed\|Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] by Paolo Freire.

I don't know for sure where this series is going to go, but I'm quite excited about it as a long-term learning content project that I can combine with some of my others - it'll be great to work alongside my [[600 Deep Dives/DIY MFA Creative Writing/DIY MFA in Creative Writing\|DIY MFA in Creative Writing]] and [[600 Deep Dives/DIY Masters in Philosophy/DIY Masters in Philosophy Plan\|DIY Masters in Philosophy Plan]].  None of these are things I have to rush.  I can savor what I'm reading and learning, adding notes and writing a bit each day, building up my content organically as I contemplate the ideas deeply over time.  I'm not on a school or corporate deadline with these - I just want to learn and share what I learn as I go.
