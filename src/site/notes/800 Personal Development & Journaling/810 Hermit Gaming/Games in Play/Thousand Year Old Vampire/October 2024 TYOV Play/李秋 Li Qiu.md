## Memory 1 
![gwynnemichele_A_mysterious_woman_wandering_along_the_ancient__505d3354-7098-4500-b440-5c556ce2b6b9_3.png](/img/user/900%20Admin%20Files/902%20Attachments/gwynnemichele_A_mysterious_woman_wandering_along_the_ancient__505d3354-7098-4500-b440-5c556ce2b6b9_3.png)
I am 李秋, the youngest daughter of a merchant who travels the Silk Road.  My father was content to allow me to travel with him, but my mother tried to force me into marriage, and I fled from the city of my birth, Chang-an (modern day [西安市](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an)) with a Persian caravan one night.

## Memory 2
Father took me on a trade journey in my 13th year.  Our camp was attacked one night.  It was terrifying.  I hid well.  Father and the other men fought them off.  I started to learn to defend myself after that night.  I never wanted to feel that helpless again.

## Memory 3
When I had my first monthly flow, my mother gave me a jade pendant.  She'd received it from her mother who'd received it from her mother.  It was said to have special powers, but mostly it just reminded me how little power I actually had.
## Memory 4
The first time I met Arash, I bought a map from him of lands I'd never even heard of.  He'd told me of a world far more vast than I could have imagined.  I wanted to see it all.  Arash's caravan was leaving the night my mother announced she'd arranged my marriage.
## Memory 5
The screams woke me up.   I froze.  I swore I'd never be afraid like that night father's came was attacked, but what could make the men scream like that?  He seemed surprised when he entered the tent and saw me sitting there alone.  I still don't know why he let me live.  If you could call this cursed existence living.

# Prompt Record
Prompt 6.  *A mortal Character begins serving you.  Who are they?  Why are they drawn to you?  Create a new mortal character.*

I wandered for days after Kallistratos turned me.  Kallistratos had told me what he'd turned me into, but I tried to resist giving into the thirst for blood.  Temptation became too great one night after a week.  The pleasure that came as that warm liquid flowed down my throat is unlike anything I've ever experienced before, and I'll never deny it again.

I didn't think there were any witnesses.  I didn't want anyone to see me like that.  How would they react?  What would they do?  

I quickly learned **Arvand** had been watching.  At first, I thought I'd have to kill him, too, or at least have to threaten him into silence.  But he didn't beg for his life, he didn't flee in terror.  He just knelt before me and vowed to serve me.

He was human, but his smell didn't tempt me like the others, and I wanted to know why.  He told me he was a guide.  Of the Yuezhi people.  His tribe had been nearly wiped out.  Most of those who remained had left to settle in a nearby Yuezhi kingdom, but having lost his entire family, Arvand chose to wander the Silk Road and guide those who needed him.

Prompt 3. *A loved one discovers your condition and works to help you. Create a Resource which represents their assistance. Create a mortal Character if none are available.*

It was only a matter of time before I would cross paths with 爸爸 (father). I'd told him my plans to leave, but didn't know if he'd heard about the camp slaughter.  He had.  He'd heard rumors of my survival as well.  He'd been told storied for years of the ones who haunted the night.  He gave me a tent.  I'd been traveling without shelter.  I didn't need it.  But I was touched that he still cared even knowing what I am.

Prompt 4. *You are exposed and flee to a neighboring region. Lose any stationary Resources. Check a Skill. A mortal flees with you. What new name do you adopt among these strangers?*
