02/15/2022 - The more I think about it, the more it would be fun to build this as a game of Gnomish Intrigure and Exploration.

Goldspark's Recovery Service - You're a gnome.  You've just been fired from your job as an adjunct professor at the university and you've been kicked out of the guild.  You're one day from being evicted from your apartment when you get a letter.  A distant relative of yours died, and you're the only eligible heir to Goldspark's Recovery Service.  Which it turns out is really just some digging, thieving, and tinkering equipment, a map, and a book of contacts.

That distant relative is [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Trixie Goldspark\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Trixie Goldspark]] and I'll play out the backstory, how she built the business, etc. and fill the book with contacts, the map with features, etc.

Thoughts about what I want to see in this world of Esteomund, how I want to do gameplay, etc.

I want to sandbox this.  I want to develop the map as I go, uncovering terrain as I move between locations.

This is a relatively safe world.  Magic mostly faded long ago after [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The War Between Viclejan and Chaconor\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The War Between Viclejan and Chaconor]] shattered [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Mage Crystal\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Mage Crystal]] which had served as a focal point and generator for [[000 Top Ideas & Active Projects/10 Fiction/The World Weaver Saga/Worldbuilding/Magic/Magic\|Magic]] in the world.  [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Viclejan\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Viclejan]] and [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Chaconor\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Chaconor]] were (presumably) destroyed, leaving behind the wastelands now known as [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Forgotten Zones\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Forgotten Zones]].

Magic does not currently really exist in Esteomund.  There are [[Rumors\|Rumors]] of it, of course.  Stories of wizards and witches living in remote places.  But mostly, Trixie figures those are just stories told to scare children.  Magic has been long gone from the world, for thousands of years, and there's no real point of seeking it.

There is, however, plenty of artifacts to seek.  Ancient dungeons full of treasure suitable for a museum.  Plenty more suitable for a pawn shop.

As far as technology, think Steampunk.  They don't have electronics, as such, but they do have [[Crystal Power\|Crystal Power]] which isn't as powerful as the Magic of The Mage Crystal, but allows people to communicate over distances - [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Guild of Tinkerers\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Guild of Tinkerers]] is even working on ways to transmit not just voices but images, too!  Crystals also serve as batteries and are used to generate power for cities as well as for small mechanical items, including [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Constructs\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/Constructs]].

I'm going to run the game, so to speak, in [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/++++Play Notes\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/++++Play Notes]] as a sort of daily log.  Day 1, Day 2, etc. with each day as headings so they can be collapsed as necessary.

I'll take liberal notes and make connections on those notes as the story unfolds.  There is no goal with what this will become, but I also won't limit what it will become.  Really, I just want to play Trixie and see how her story unfolds.

*Why was Trixie Goldspark fired from the University and kicked out of the Guild?*

She doesn't know.  She was just told it was for "downsizing."

I think at this point, I need to bust out the Mythic GM emulator and start working through that.  Because she doesn't know why she was fired, but there might be something going on!
