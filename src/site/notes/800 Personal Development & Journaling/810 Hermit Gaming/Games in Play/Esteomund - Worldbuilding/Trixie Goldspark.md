*Trixie was recently kicked out of [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Guild of Tinkerers\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/The Guild of Tinkerers]]* *and fired from her job as a Adjunct Professor at the [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/University of Pichetope\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/University of Pichetope]]* *so right now, she's looking for any work she can get using the skills she has.  She was an adjunct professor of Bookbinding and Mapmaking.

What are those skills?

*Tinkering*
*Bookbinding* - not all books are magical, but only trained bookbinders can bind usable grimoires.
*Mapmaking* - not all maps are magical, but only trained mapmakers can make usable magical maps.

What's the work?

*Trixie runs Goldspark Recovery Service, specializing in recovering artifacts of significant historical and financial value from dungeons around the realm.

*Well, that's the dream anyway.  Trixie's never actually been in a dungeon before and she hasn't technically had any clients, but she will!

What is the world that Trixie Resides in?

[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/+++Esteomund\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Play/Esteomund - Worldbuilding/+++Esteomund]]  *I am creating this world from scratch, as well as the rules for playing this character.  I don't know that this will be a public game, I really just want to play with this character and see what I can come up with.  If it does become a public game, that would be great, too!*

What do I want from this game/character/world?

*I want to have fun.  I want to create a fun sandbox exploration mechanic that can be adapted for any world or character to play in.*

*I also want to use this as a mechanic for building worlds and generating characters to explore more in depth.*

*So I guess I want to develop a sort of fiction-writing solo game?*
