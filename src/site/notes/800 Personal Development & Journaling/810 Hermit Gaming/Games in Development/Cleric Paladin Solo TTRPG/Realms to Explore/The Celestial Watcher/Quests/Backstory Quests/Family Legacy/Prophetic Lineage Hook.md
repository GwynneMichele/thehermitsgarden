1. **Visions as Nightmares**: The visions disturb your sleep, and you're always tired until this is resolved.
    
    - **Initial Task**: Seek out a healer or a shaman who can brew a potion or conduct a ritual that stabilizes your sleep patterns, but requires a special ingredient or task from you in return.
2. **Cryptic Message**: A stranger approaches you with a message that corresponds with your visions.
    
    - **Initial Task**: Follow a set of instructions detailed in the cryptic message, which will lead you to a secluded place where a trial or revelation awaits. Prepare yourself adequately, as you have no idea what to expect.
3. **Public Omen**: A celestial event visible to all triggers the start of your visions.
    
    - **Initial Task**: Engage in public discourse—be it at a forum, religious gathering, or town meeting—to discuss the omen's significance and glean more context surrounding its relation to your visions.
4. **Family Discord**: Relatives challenge the legitimacy of your claim to the family's prophetic lineage. They insist on a test to prove your worth.
    
    - **Initial Task**: Enter a family shrine to retrieve an artifact that only the true prophetic heir can touch.
