**Overview:**
A Survival Camp is a settlement established in remote or hostile environments, designed to support the basic needs of its inhabitants. These camps can vary in purpose, from serving as refuges for explorers and adventurers to acting as places of exile or punishment.

**Location:**
Survival Camps can be found in a variety of challenging terrains, including deserts, jungles, mountains, and tundras. Their locations are typically chosen for strategic reasons, such as proximity to resources, defensibility, or isolation.

**Structure:**
The layout and structure of a Survival Camp depend on the environment and the resources available. Common features include communal living spaces, storage areas for food and supplies, and designated zones for specific activities such as cooking, crafting, and training.

**Security:**
Security measures vary based on the threats present in the surrounding environment. This can range from simple fences or barricades to more complex defenses like watchtowers, traps, and magical wards.

**Life in the Camp:**
Life in a Survival Camp is often marked by a focus on basic survival and self-sufficiency. Residents may need to hunt, gather, or farm for food, maintain shelters, and manage limited resources. The social structure and governance of the camp can vary widely based on its purpose and the backgrounds of its inhabitants.

**Challenges:**
Survival Camps face numerous challenges, including harsh environmental conditions, scarcity of resources, threats from wildlife or hostile forces, and the psychological strain of isolation or confinement.

**Notable Features:**
- **Resource Management:** Efficient use of resources is crucial for the sustainability of the camp.
- **Adaptability:** The ability to adapt to changing conditions and unexpected challenges is vital for survival.
