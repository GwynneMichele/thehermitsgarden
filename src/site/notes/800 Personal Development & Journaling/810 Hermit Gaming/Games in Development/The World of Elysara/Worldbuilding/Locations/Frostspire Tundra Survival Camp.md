**Exile Survival Camp - Frostspire Tundra, Elysara**

---

**Overview:**
The Exile Survival Camp is a remote settlement located in a secluded valley within the Frostspire Mountains. Established by the Technocrat Union, the camp serves as a place of banishment for individuals deemed too dangerous or undesirable to remain within the Union's more civilized regions.

**Location:**
Situated in the harsh, icy wilderness of the Frostspire Tundra, the camp is surrounded by towering ice spires and rugged terrain. Access to the camp is limited, with passage in and out being both costly and restricted to the brief summer months.

**Structure:**
The camp is designed for survival rather than comfort. It features a central hub with administrative buildings, a medical center, and a communal dining hall. Surrounding the hub are clusters of small, basic dwellings where the exiles reside. The camp also includes designated areas for training, workshops, and storage to support the inhabitants' needs.

**Security:**
A defensive wall encircles the camp, providing a measure of protection against the tundra's dangers. Additionally, an anti-porting dome covers the entire area, preventing magical teleportation into or out of the camp, further ensuring that the exiles remain isolated.

**Life in the Camp:**
Life in the Exile Survival Camp is challenging, with residents contending with the extreme cold, limited resources, and the psychological toll of isolation. The camp operates on a strict schedule, with inhabitants expected to contribute to the community's survival through various tasks and duties. Social hierarchies and power dynamics often emerge, adding complexity to the camp's social fabric.

**Governance:**
The camp is overseen by a warden appointed by the Technocrat Union, who is responsible for maintaining order and ensuring the camp's smooth operation. A small contingent of guards assists the warden in enforcing the rules and managing the exiles.

**Notable Residents:**
The camp is home to a diverse group of exiles, including former members of the Technocrat Union, rogue mages, and other individuals with unique skills or knowledge. Each resident has their own story of how they came to be banished to this frozen purgatory.
