### Notes
I want this to be a game that you can pick up and put down as you need.  Roll through a couple days in your spare time, and revisit the Village whenever you feel like it.  As you come back to your Village, you might work on the map a bit more - add some color to those gardens, some detail to you Apothecary.  In the [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Extended Edition\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Extended Edition]], you'll be able to add to the island map, treck through unexplored territory, discover new resources and treasures that can be used to fulfill Special Visitor quests, as well as enlist the aid of Island Residents - mysterious and magical people who can give you bonus resources and tap into magic you didn't know exists.


### Main

What's the bare minimum that I need to make a functional quickstart guide for game testing?

It doesn't have to be pretty.  It just has to get out there.

I need to define the process for:

[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Character Creation\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Character Creation]]
[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Village Building\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Village Building]]
[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Visitors & Recruiting Villagers\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Visitors & Recruiting Villagers]]
[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Resource Management\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Resource Management]]

So there will be:

[[Playbook\|Playbook]]:

	[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Village Roster\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Village Roster]]

Still in development. 
I want to spend some time hyperfocusing on this one again so that I can get the quickstart/playtest guide out there and start getting some feedback on it.

I need to finalize the character development process, the Village creation process - gathering and managing resources - as well as the Villager generation process.  The larger mapping and resource-development can come later.

02/15/2022

I need to decide what goes in the character sheet.  Which I honestly don't think is going to be much because this isn't so much a character focused RPG as it is a Village-focused building and resource management RPG, which means I really need a Village Roster where the Caretaker aka the Player Character is the top of that, and then as Villagers are recruited from Visitors, they can be filled in on the sections below the Caretaker, adding more sheets as necessary.

The [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Quickstart Guide\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Quickstart Guide]] will have two main parts - the [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Instructions\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Instructions]] and the [[Playbook\|Playbook]] which will include a section of [[Tables\|Tables]] and [[Playsheets\|Playsheets]].

The [[Village Map\|Village Map]] will use 1-inch hexpaper for mapping out the village.  Big enough that it's easy to write or draw whatever you want in them.  I also want to have little building pictures in hexes that people can cut out and tape/glue onto their map if they want the more visual representation, but don't draw.

In the expansion/full game version, the [[Village Map\|Village Map]] will still be 1-inch hex, and the [[Island Map\|Island Map]] will be .25 or .20 inch hex - 4 or 5 hexes per inch with simpler symbols for terrain types.
