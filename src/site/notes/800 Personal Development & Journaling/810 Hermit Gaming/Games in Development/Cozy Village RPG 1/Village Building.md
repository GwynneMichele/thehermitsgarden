Village Building is one of the pillars of the game, and really, the main focus.  You recruit Visitors into Villagers in order to expand your Village.

Village is built on a 1-inch hex map, with each 1-inch hex being a Lot in the Village.

You start with the Well of Wonder at the center, needing to be rebuilt with 1d4 wood, 1d4 stone, and 1d4 herbs - which you will have in your resources at the beginning of the game.  Once you've built the well, you get (1d4 x well level) of water per day.

You also need to clear a lot and build your Caretaker's Cottage - no other building can be built until you've built it.

When you clear a lot, you get 1d4 wood and 1d4 stone.

Once you have cleared a lot, you can build whatever you want there, provided you have enough resources and have met the requirements to build.

To upgrade a building, double the resource dice, both for building and for production.

*Example: I want to upgrade my level 1 Blacksmith to level 2.  I roll 2d4 for stone, 2d4 for ore, and 2d4 for metal.*

If a building requires another building, that required building must be at or above the level you want to upgrade your other building to.

*Example:  Before I can upgrade the Blacksmith to level 2, the Ore Node must have been upgraded to level 2 or higher.*
