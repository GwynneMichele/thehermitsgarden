To run a Village, you need the right people with the right skills to run the buildings in the village in order to produce the resources you need to grow the village.

You have a 1d4 chance each day of a Visitor coming to you.  If you get a 1, you get a Visitor.  Any other roll, there is no Visitor that day. 

On days when you have a Visitor, use the Visitor Tables to determine who the Visitor is, what they want, what they have to offer, etc.

Visitors have a Profession, with the default skills for that profession.  They have one additional skill.  They have 1d4 points in each skill.  

Professions are same as [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Character Creation\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Playsheets & Guides/Character Creation]]
Skills are same as in Character creation.

To recruit a Visitor, you must meet their Requirements.  Every Recruit requires a Cottage of their own, and a Job to do.  Visitors also must match the requirements of the job you want to assign them to before you can recruit them.  Once the requirements are met, you automatically recruit the Visitor and they become a Villager.
