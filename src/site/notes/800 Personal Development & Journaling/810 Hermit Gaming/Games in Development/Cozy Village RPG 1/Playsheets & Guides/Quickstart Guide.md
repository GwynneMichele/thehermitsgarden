I want the Quickstart Guide to be ready by the end of this month, so I have basically two weeks to do that.

I want people to be able to print it out and dive right into playing, so it needs to include everything they need in order to do that, except for dice and pencil, of course.

I might also create an Obsidian Vault that they can download that will allow them to play the game in Preview mode, dice rolls and all, by simply clicking through and recording on the Playbook which would be in edit mode....  *dude how cool would that to create a whole game in Obsidian?*

==

I can start the Quickstart Guide with a Tutorial - take them day-by-day through Week 1 of running the Village, adding new concepts and buildings each day, with day 7 having a Special Visitor showing up to Bless the Well of Wonder.

During the tutorial week, two miners, a logger/forester, a gardener, and a hunter will show up.

This will have them set up and ready with a functioning village producing resources that they can then distribute and use to build more advanced buildings and recruit more advanced villagers for those buildings.

The tutorial will be optional - that way, if you want to make another village, you can start it however you want.
