# Character Creation
You are an elderly adventure, retired from adventuring because your body just can't take it anymore.  You come home one day to find a [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Magical Letter\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Magical Letter]] waiting for you.  Opening it, you discover that you're being offered the job of Caretaker of the [[Village at the Nexus of all Worlds\|Village at the Nexus of all Worlds]].  Will you go?

What did you do before you retired?

You can roll for your previous profession - 1d6 - or you can simply choose one.

*Example:  Jane rolls 1d6 and gets 1.  She was a Warrior in her previous profession.*

| 1d6 | Former Profession | Story Seed |
| --- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 1   | Warrior           |            |
| 2   | Rogue             |            |
| 3   | Ranger            |            |
| 4   | Wizard            |            |
| 5   | Witch             |            |
| 6   | Priest            |            |

[[900 Admin Files/990 Old Vaults/The Tome/100 Inboxes/Next Steps/Next Steps\|900 Admin Files/990 Old Vaults/The Tome/100 Inboxes/Next Steps/Next Steps]]  Write some story seeds to help with players developing a backstory for their character.

Your previous profession determines what your starting cart load is - the resources and skills that you start with.

*Example:  As a Warrior, Jane starts with 28 Food + 28 water, 10 Wood, 20 Stone, 20 Metal, 10 Ore, 10 Meat, 10 Vegetables, and 10 Herbs.*


## Resources
| Resource   | Starting Load | Profession Bonuses | Profession Bonuses |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Food       | 28            |                    |                    |
| Water      | 28            |                    |                    |
| Wood       | 10            | Ranger +10         |                    |
| Stone      | 10            | Wizard +10         | Warrior +10        |
| Metal      | 10            | Warrior +10        |                    |
| Ore        | 10            | Rogue +10          | Priest +10         |
| Meat       | 10            | Rogues +10         | Ranger +10         |
| Vegetables | 10            | Witch +10          |                    |
| Herbs      | 10            | Witch +10          | Wizard +10         |


## Skills 

Now you need to note your skills.  Everyone starts with 1 skill level in Cooking + Building.  Each profession also gets 1 skill level in two skills.  Roll 1d12 to determine an additional skill that your character has, and then explain in your backstory how you came about that skill.  If you roll a skill that you already have, you can roll again for a new skill OR you can add an additional point to that skill.

*Example:  As a Warrior, Jane starts with Cooking, Mining, Blascksmithing, and Building as her Base Skills.  She rolls 1d12 and gets 2.  She decides to apply the bonus point to her Mining rather than reroll, so her starting Skills are: Cooking +1, Mining +2, Blacksmithing +1, and Building +1*

| 1d12 | Skill         | Profession Bonus |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 1    | Cooking       | Everyone         |
| 2    | Mining        | Warrior          |
| 3    | Logging       | Ranger           |
| 4    | Carpentry     | Ranger           |
| 5    | Blacksmithing | Warrior          |
| 6    | Potionmaking  | Witch            |
| 7    | Innkeeping    | Rogue  Wizard    |
| 8    | Sales         | Priest  Rogue    |
| 9    | Gardening     | Witch            |
| 10   | Librarian     | Wizard           |
| 11   | Postmaster    | Priest           |
| 12   | Building      | Everyone         |


I think I might change this.  Instead of a big list of skills, everyone will have Cooking, Mining, Logging, Gardening, and Building as basic skills that can be leveled up with Skill Books.

Then each Role will have a level, with specific skill requirements to level up.

So a Blacksmith needs Mining +2 and Building +2 in order to advance to level 2.

So people really won't even be able to level up until after the library is complete which is one of the last buidings!
