[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Cozy Village RPG\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Cozy Village RPG]]

### Game Progression v .2
Create character, fill out initial [[Playbook\|Playbook]] slots.
Plan your Village, marking building foundations on your Village Map.
As you mark a building foundation, roll to clear - you get 1d4 x your build level of stone and 1d4 times your build level of wood for each lot you clear, which can give you much-needed building resources early.  -1 [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points]]
When you have enough resources to build level 1 of a building, and the building foundation has already been marked, you can build that building.  -1 [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points]]
Mark another building foundation, roll to clear -1 [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points]]
Build another building -1 [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Action Points]]

That will be the basic daily flow until the [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Building Types/Well of Wonder\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG 1/Building Types/Well of Wonder]] is built.

*I could do a Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, etc. tutorial like thing, where I walk the person through character creation, then day 1, building the well and the caretaker's cottage, then day 2, gathering water, rolling for Visitors, cooking meat & vegetables into food, then day 3, clearing lots and building resource lots, etc.*

Game play will be tracked day-by-day, referring to the Map and the Village Roster to determine resource rolls and amounts.
