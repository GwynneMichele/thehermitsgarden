Action Points create a limit on how many things you can do per day.  Once you're out of Action Points for the day, you have to go to sleep for the night to regain them.

To begin, the Caretaker - Player Character - gets 4 Action Points per level.  At the beginning of the game, they are a Level 1 Caretaker, and so they get 4 Action Points.
