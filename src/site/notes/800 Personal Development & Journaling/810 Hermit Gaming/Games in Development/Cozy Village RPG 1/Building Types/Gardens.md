Gardens take up an entire lot.

When you build a garden, you must plant either a Vegetable or an Herb, which will determine what resources you get each day from that garden.

It's magical, so it'll begin producing resources the day after it is built.

Each garden level requires a gardener of that level or higher, plus one gardener for each lower level.

So a level 1 garden requires a level 1 or higher gardener (though higher level gardeners are unlikely to want to work in a lower level garden!)

A level 2 garden requires one level 2 or higher gardener and an additional gardener of any level.

A level 3 garden requires one level 3 or higher gardener, a level 2 or higher gardener, and an additionial gardener of any level.

A level 4 garden requires one level 4 gardener, a level 3 or higher gardener, a level 2 or higher gardener, and an additional gardener of any level.

*Example:  You have a level 4 garden with 4 gardeners, levels 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Each day, your garden produces 1d4 x garden level x HIGHEST gardener level

*Example: Your garden produces 1d4 x 4 x 4 herb/vegetables per day.*

At maximum occupancy and maximum skill levels, you have a maximum of 64 herbs/vegetables produced per day.

Each garden consumes 1d4 x garden level water per day.

*Example:  Your level 4 garden consumes 1d4 x 4 water per day.*

A well can support up to six surrounding gardens, so plan accordingly!
