[[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Cozy Village RPG\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Cozy Village RPG]]

I have a LOT of ideas for this game.  I want to keep the [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Playsheets & Guides/Quickstart Guide\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Playsheets & Guides/Quickstart Guide]] simple, focused on Village Building and resource management.

But I also want to do an Extended Edition or Full Version of it that will be more involved, have additional resources and production items, as well as have Map Exploration/Generation and Questing mechanics related to [[Special Visitors\|Special Visitors]] and [[Island Residents\|Island Residents]].
