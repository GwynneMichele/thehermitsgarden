Resource Management is going to be a major core of the game, after and connecting to clearing and building the Village.

Lots must be cleared - which grants a certain amount of resources which can be used towards building various important Village Buildings and Residences for Villagers to run those Buildings.

Certain buildings require other buildings be finished first - this will become even more relevant in the full game/expansion after the Quickstart Guide.

## Villager Requirements
Each Villager has requirements for resources depending on their Role and their level.
ALL Villagers require 1 Water and 1 Food per day (unless otherwise noted... Hunter's, for example, only require water since they can provide their own food.  Witches only require food because they visit the [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Well of Wonder\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Well of Wonder]] themselves and gather their own water.)

This means you need to make sure you have enough [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Gardens\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Gardens]], [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Hunter's Hut\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Hunter's Hut]]s and [[800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Wells\|800 Personal Development & Journaling/810 Hermit Gaming/Games in Development/Cozy Village RPG/Building Types/Wells]] to supply enough food and water to your Village.
