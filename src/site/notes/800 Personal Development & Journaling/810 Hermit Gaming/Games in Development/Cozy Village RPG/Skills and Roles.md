## Basic Skills
Everyone starts at 1 skill level for each of these:
	Building
	Mining
	Logging
	Cooking
	Gathering (Useful for hunting and gardening)

## Roles
Different roles require different skills to improve in order to advance in level.  Once the skills are at the appropriate level - through assignment and consumption of Skill Books - the character/NPC automatically levels up and gets the appropriate resource bonuses that go with the level.

Worker Roles require only one major skill to advance.

Miner = Mining
Forester = Logging
Gardener = Gardening
Hunter = Hunting
Cook = Cooking

Specialist Roles require at least two major skills to advance.

Smith = Mining + Building
Carpenter = Logging + Building
Witch = Gardening + Cooking
Librarian = Witch Level 2 + Sales
Postmaster = Librarian Level 3 + Sales
Clerk = Sales + Innkeeping

Skills can be gained from Skill Books which can be received from visitors, and later, can be made by Librarians.  Once consumed, Skill Books are gone forever and that skillbook must be remade if you wish to develop that skill in another villager.
