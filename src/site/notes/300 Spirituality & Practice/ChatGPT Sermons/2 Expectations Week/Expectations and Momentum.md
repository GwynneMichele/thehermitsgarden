*I had ChatGPT write these "sermons" for my own personal contemplative practices, but found them so moving and profound, I knew I needed to share them.*

**Sermon for Expectations Week: Tuesday – Momentum**

Beloved wanderers on this journey of Becoming, today we stand at the intersection of Expectations and Momentum. We’ve spent time reflecting on the weight and nature of our expectations, but today, the question becomes: *What do we do with them?* Expectations, once clarified, have the potential to create an energy within us—a momentum that carries us forward, or, if mishandled, an inertia that holds us back.

Momentum, by its nature, demands movement. It requires action, propulsion, and a deliberate choice to step into the flow of our lives. But here's the paradox: not all movement is progress. We can move quickly, fueled by the expectations of others or the frantic need to prove ourselves, and yet feel no closer to the life we truly desire. Or, we can move slowly, deliberately, intentionally, and find ourselves inching closer to the center of who we are meant to be.

The Expectations we hold set the course for this movement. They are like the wind in our sails, and they can either propel us forward toward our purpose, or they can push us off course, into the choppy waters of doubt, burnout, or confusion. So, as we consider Momentum today, let us ask: *What is driving my movement?* Are my Expectations aligned with my truth, or am I merely drifting on the winds of external pressure?

Momentum is not about speed. It’s about direction. And sometimes, the greatest Momentum comes from the smallest, most intentional steps. One task completed. One promise to yourself kept. One expectation clarified and embraced. That is how we build real, sustainable progress.

Expectations become our fuel, but we must learn to harness them, to use them wisely. There will be days when Momentum feels like a strong current, carrying us effortlessly toward our goals. On those days, we ride the wave, grateful for the wind at our backs. But there will also be days when the waters feel still, and the sail hangs limp. On those days, we must become our own wind. We must find the strength to create our own momentum, even in the smallest of ways.

And here’s the truth, dear souls: Even the smallest step forward is still movement. Even the tiniest bit of progress, the smallest act of alignment with our Expectations, creates ripples. Ripples that build and build until they become waves of change, waves of growth, waves of transformation.

So today, let us honor Momentum by honoring the Expectations we have chosen to keep. Let us move with purpose, not out of obligation, but out of a desire to move closer to the truth of who we are. Whether it’s a burst of energy or a gentle nudge, trust that the movement you create today is enough. Trust that every step, no matter how small, is part of the greater flow, the larger rhythm of your Becoming.

Momentum is not measured in miles but in moments of alignment. With every intentional act, we create the momentum that will carry us into tomorrow—and the next day—and the next.

So, let us ask ourselves: *What is one small thing I can do today to honor my Expectations?* And let us take that step, knowing that even in its smallness, it has the power to shift the entire trajectory of our lives.

Amen.
