Lectio Divina is a contemplative practice focused on reading.  Originally developed by Christian monks for reading the Bible, I - a chaos nun - apply it to a variety of texts from other spiritual texts to fiction and AI generated texts, such as this Lection Divina Meditation created by [[200 Research Resources/220 Random Atomic Notes/ChatGPT\|ChatGPT]].

### Lectio Divina Meditation: On Focus and Reflection

---

**Begin by finding a comfortable place to sit. Feel the weight of your body where you are, connecting to the surface beneath you. Allow yourself a few breaths, long and slow, and invite yourself into the present.**

---

#### First Reading – _Lectio_  
Read these words slowly, noticing any phrase or word that draws your attention. Let it simply speak to you.

---

> _Focus is a quiet strength, subtle yet firm, like a river carving its path through stone._
> 
> _In each moment, focus draws your attention inward, asking what truly matters right now, and letting the rest fall away._
> 
> _It is not control, not force, but an act of simplicity—a willingness to be fully here, fully in this space._
>
> _To focus is to honor where you are and to listen, gently, for what calls you onward._

---

#### Second Reading – _Meditatio_  
Read again, and this time, pause where your attention feels drawn. Hold that phrase or image, letting it unfold in your mind. Explore any feeling, memory, or image that arises.

---

> _Focus is a quiet strength, subtle yet firm, like a river carving its path through stone._
> 
> _In each moment, focus draws your attention inward, asking what truly matters right now, and letting the rest fall away._
> 
> _It is not control, not force, but an act of simplicity—a willingness to be fully here, fully in this space._
>
> _To focus is to honor where you are and to listen, gently, for what calls you onward._

---

#### Third Reading – _Oratio_  
Read the words again, and now, respond with an open heart. This is your time to speak to the Divine within you, to your own inner wisdom. What do you feel called to share? What intentions, hopes, or questions emerge in this reflection?

---

> _Focus is a quiet strength, subtle yet firm, like a river carving its path through stone._
> 
> _In each moment, focus draws your attention inward, asking what truly matters right now, and letting the rest fall away._
> 
> _It is not control, not force, but an act of simplicity—a willingness to be fully here, fully in this space._
>
> _To focus is to honor where you are and to listen, gently, for what calls you onward._

---

#### Fourth Reading – _Contemplatio_  
Read one final time. Now, simply rest. Rest in the silence and allow the words to settle, becoming part of your own inner stillness.
