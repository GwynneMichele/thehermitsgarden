# Sacred Fiction: How Jediism Bridges Popular Culture and Religious Practice

## Introduction: "The Force as a Path to Meaning"

Jediism, a modern spiritual movement born from the fictional universe of Star Wars, offers a fascinating intersection between popular culture and religious practice. This paper delves into the evolution of Jediism from a playful nod to fandom into a meaningful spiritual identity for its adherents. By exploring its mythology, rituals, and decentralized practices, we uncover how Jediism redefines what it means to engage with faith in a hyper-connected, secularized world.

While inspired by the works of George Lucas, rooted in Joseph Campbell’s mythological frameworks and a blend of global religious influences, Jediism transcends its fictional origins. For its followers, the philosophy of the Force, the ethical framework of the Jedi Code, and the archetypes of its stories provide a rich tapestry to navigate questions central to human existence: Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going?.

## Jediism in Context: A Religion Born of Fiction

Jediism is a modern spiritual movement that finds its inspiration in the Star Wars universe created by George Lucas, and now being continually expanded by Disney. What started as a fictional narrative inspired by Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey mythological framework and concepts from several major religions has evolved into a meaningful religious identity for its many adherents around the world. While it originated in pop culture—a fictional movie franchise—it is not a parody religion. It is not poking fun at religion but is a sincere practice for its followers, who draw on the philosophy, ethics, and mythology seen in the Star Wars franchise to try to answer those fundamental questions about our existence: Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going?

Those who follow Jediism are diverse and multicultural. It is not a religion that demands renouncing membership to other religions—one could theoretically be a Christian Jedi, much like some Buddhists express that one can be both Buddhist and Christian, as Buddhism does not require belief in a deity, nor does it explicitly deny such. Some members of Jediism see their practice as an enhancement to existing beliefs, while others see it as a complete spirituality in and of itself. Inclusivity is a hallmark of the movement, which emphasizes themes such as balance, mindfulness, and the pursuit of justice.

Practices are varied, reflecting the decentralized nature of the religion. While there are formalized "churches" that have gained some legal recognition, no single group can claim exclusivity over the religious practices, which are often centered on personal development, with the community existing to support the continued growth of individual members. The Force is a core concept—the "energy" that binds all life together within the metaphysical framework of Star Wars mythology—but interpretations of it vary from group to group and member to member. Some see it as a metaphor, while others view it as a real, active force in their lives and the universe.
  

## A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Not So Far Away: The History of Jediism

The history of Jediism starts with the release of George Lucas's Star Wars in 1977. It captivated audiences with its epic storytelling and cutting-edge effects, spawning an entire franchise that is still in production 47 years later. Star Wars introduced the world to the Jedi Order—a martial group of warrior-philosophers guided by their spiritual connection to "The Force". Sequels, prequels, cartoons, novels, and more have come out in the intervening years, building on that mythology.

This led to a very small early internet movement of people attempting to live by a "Jedi Code." However, it did not gain significant momentum until the Jedi Census movement of 2001, in which individuals in countries such as the UK and Australia were encouraged to list "Jedi" as their religion on the official census. For many, this was a prank or a playful act of fandom; however, for a significant number, it was a genuine expression of their beliefs and practices. This brought global attention to Jediism, challenging traditional notions of religion while drawing more members to the movement.

## Mythology: "The Force, the Code, and the Cosmos"

Star Wars is undeniably mythological—the grandmaster of mythological studies, Joseph Campbell, even admitted as much and developed a friendship with George Lucas over the years. Lucas had studied Campbell's mythological framework, The Hero's Journey, before and during the writing of the original trilogy.

But it wasn’t just the work of Campbell that George Lucas studied to develop the myths at the center of the Star Wars universe. According to him, he studied a large variety of religions, looking for the "universal" teachings, which is where the idea of the Force came from.

Star Wars is a very American mythology—space revolutionaries and freedom fighters—rooted mostly in the framework of European myths as studied by Campbell, but also drawing on Asian religious beliefs and practices. The balance between the Light and Dark sides of the Force is clearly inspired by Taoism and the 阴阳 (Yin-Yang) balance inherent in that tradition. The martial practices with lightsabers and combat training are also inspired by the monastic martial traditions of Asian religions.

My interest this semester, though, is in how people have been inspired by the mythology that George Lucas created and begun turning it into a New Religious Movement, with multiple branches, some legal recognition in the United States and New Zealand, and active, growing communities on the internet that adapt that fictional mythology into a guiding mythology for living lives.

As people feel more and more disconnected with the myths of the past, they’re turning to modern myths—Star Wars, superheroes, etc.—and, in some cases, turning them into living religions. Is this appropriation? Syncretism? How does Star Wars being owned by Disney—who is ruthless in protecting their copyright—affect those who profess to have faith in Jediism? What does it mean to have "faith" in a "fictional" mythology? 

And it is a vast—and growing—mythology. Each member of the Jedi faith—regardless of the specific group they’re affiliated with—is encouraged to interpret the stories as they see fit. Debate is, of course, welcome, but it’s a religion that is focused primarily on individual growth, with the community existing to support that individual growth. This may be a characteristic of being a movement that exists mostly online, with only a few offline locations for members to gather in formal services.

In Star Wars mythology, we have the reluctant hero with daddy issues—Luke Skywalker, and of course, that father he’s got those issues with, Darth Vader, formerly known as Anakin Skywalker. Light Luke and Dark Darth, who are connected in ways that neither is aware of at the beginning of the saga—the darkness having fathered the light.

Beyond just the initial trilogy, we see those mythological themes repeating in every subsequent trilogy and the various other movies and series that have developed since Disney took over. We see Anakin Skywalker embark on his own "hero’s journey." However, rather than moving towards the light, he turns towards darkness when faced with trials—a lesson for the audience about the price of power. We see Rey in the later movies on her own Hero’s Journey, finding her mentor just as Luke had to find his.

There’s the Sacred Sword—the lightsaber—and the connection the Jedi has to it, not to be used for aggressive violence but only in defense, at least for those on the Light side of the Force.

We have tricksters—Lando could be seen as one, and there’s great debate in the fan culture (which has significant overlap with practitioners of the Jedi religion) as to whether Jar Jar Binks was really a bumbling idiot or whether the idiocy covered more nefarious motivations and skills.

We even have a redemption arc as Darth Vader turns on his own dark side mentor, and we discover that he becomes a Force ghost, appearing in an uninjured state to assure Luke he had not, after all, been lost to the dark side of the Force, indicating a belief in some sort of afterlife. That motif of redemption is repeated throughout the series with various characters who may not always make the best decisions but still have opportunities for improvement throughout their stories—a reminder that we can always improve ourselves no matter where we might have been before.

## Ritual: "Practicing the Ways of the Force"

I chose to study Jediism this semester because I've already spent time studying a huge variety of religions in my own spiritual journey. It’s been a very wandering journey that’s taken me from Christianity to Wicca to Discordianism to Buddhism to eclectic paganism and between and beyond all of them. Religion is also one of my lifelong special interests, so I wanted to study something that I only really had some very superficial knowledge of—as in, I knew it existed, there was even some legal recognition, and having dabbled with Discordianism and the Church of All Worlds in my 20s, I understood the concept of "made-up" religions quite well.

I can say that I’m very glad I picked the Jedi religion because I’ve been able to see more deeply into what I now know are called "hyper-real" religions—religions that blend pop culture with spirituality, Jediism being the most prominent of these.

It started as a sort of census joke a couple of decades ago, but then people began to take it a bit more seriously. Why not? Jedi mythology was well-developed—not just in the movies, but also in books. And that was before Disney bought the franchise and started putting even more material out, giving those following the faith even more content to draw from—and debate about.

Jediism mostly exists online. The most prominent and well-organized group, with legal recognition that allows them to grant ordination to their clergy, is the Temple of the Jedi Order. Almost all activity happens online, including a seminary for training to become clergy, though one does not have to be clergy to undergo Jedi training.

Rituals include ceremonies of knighthood, which require months or even years of study depending on the dedication of the aspirant Jedi.

While there are some community rituals and ceremonies—legal ordination means Jedi clergy can perform marriage and funeral services—most Jedi ritual and practice is focused on personal development through mindfulness, study of Jedi ethics and philosophies, as well as the real-world religions and philosophies that served as George Lucas's inspiration for the Force and the ethics of the Jedi Order. These are individual practices—though there are many places online where practitioners gather to discuss their practices and debate the ethics and philosophies of the Jedi religion. It’s not set in stone; they know the myths aren’t "real," but they’re connecting to them on a level that gives them comfort and guidance in a world where they haven’t been able to find that elsewhere. "We have to own the fact that we’re borrowing our myth from a bunch of movies, but they give us a really solid starting point" says Alex, a Jedi Knight of the Temple of the Jedi Order .

There are holidays, such as Youngling Day, which is "to honour our legacy and traditions by passing them on to those who will continue them". There are also monthly themes for reflection—for example, October is "Foolishness, yet Wisdom," with each member encouraged to reflect on these in their own way.

There is also an interesting intersection with cosplay and ritual in the form of charity groups, such as the Saber Guild, which overlaps with many members also belonging to the Temple of the Jedi Order or other Jedi religious/spiritual path groups. For the non-Jediist members of those groups, it’s a fun event where they get to act like characters in their favorite franchise while raising money for charity. But for those who practice the Jedi religion, it has the potential to become a ritual, acting out dramas that allow them to more deeply embody and internalize the teachings of the myths that they’ve found spiritual inspiration in and, in some cases, spent years studying and shaping their lives around.

## Authorities and Specialists: "Knights, Masters, and Mentors"

To look at ritual specialists in Jediism, I decided to focus specifically on the Temple of the Jedi Order. With the focus in Jediism being more about individualistic personal growth, in a way, every member of the order becomes a ritual specialist. The system of study and advancement through the degrees makes this even more clear. As a member studies within the Jedi religion, advancing through the initiate program and beyond grants them various degrees of status within the order—Novice, Initiate, Apprentice, Knight, Senior Knight, Master, Grand Master. Each member of the Temple interacts with the Force for themselves; there is no intermediary conveying the messages of spirits or deities. The ranks are indications of a member’s level of education within the religion. Knights and above mentor those who are beginning to advance through the ranks, providing support through a centralized discussion board run by the Temple.

There are two layers of authority within the Temple of the Jedi Order. On one level, all Jedi derive authority from the Force to direct their own lives. The community and clergy are there for support, but it is the individual Jedi who must study and develop themselves. Then there is the hierarchical structure of the order itself, with a system for legal recognition as clergy within the religion that requires the person seeking ordination to have reached at least the level of Initiate. This requires completing a series of written assignments assessed by multiple members of the Temple who have already completed the process. This process can take many months to complete, requiring a level of devotion to achieve the goal. It is not the "Force" that defines their authority in these cases but the Temple itself, which uses a hierarchical structure reminiscent of some mainstream religions, with formal teaching programs for the various ranks and a separate seminary program for clergy.

As with other religions in the U.S., clergy within the Temple of the Jedi Order can perform weddings in all fifty states. So, if you ever know someone who wants to get married by a Jedi Master, as long as they’re legal clergy of the Temple, it’s good to go!

Meditation is a big part of the practices of Jediism, and while this can produce altered states, they are not really the goal of the practices. Instead, meditation is about self-development and discipline, studying the teachings of the order, and developing a personal code of ethics that aligns with the ethical teachings of the Temple. The Force is not seen as a sentient entity, so there are no real attempts to communicate with it. Meditation within the Jedi religion is a way to refine the self—the Force is everywhere and within everything, so meditation becomes a way to become more aware of that for members of the Jedi religion.

The Temple of the Jedi Order, and other Jedi religious groups and organizations, are developing within the context of growing disillusionment with mainstream religions prevalent in the West, especially in the United States, where organizations have had an easier time gaining legal recognition as religious groups than in other countries. Jediism is a syncretic religion that draws on a fictional mythology, which itself draws on a variety of real-world sources for inspiration. Members often return to those real-world inspirations for further learning while maintaining the context of that fictional mythology.

It is an individualistic religion that is still managing to grow and maintain community primarily through the internet rather than in-person growth, as religions in the past did. It is a religion giving members a sense of meaning through a fictional franchise that has influenced multiple generations of people.

The Jedi and the Galaxy: Engagement with Other Systems  
Jediism occupies an interesting position in the broader landscape of religious systems. George Lucas drew on a variety of religious and spiritual traditions in the creation of the mythology within Star Wars. Ideals of balance, selflessness, and mindfulness align well with Buddhism, and the ideals of sacrifice and service are prominent within Christianity. This syncretism makes it easier for some adherents to integrate Jedi practices and teachings into their existing religious practices. At the same time, the decentralized nature of Jediism distinguishes it from more high-control, centralized religions.

Jediism’s very status as a religion is still debated. Some countries have denied legal recognition of it as a religion, but in the U.S., the Temple of the Jedi was granted legal recognition, putting it on the same legal status as other religions with a more traditional history. Some see it as a mockery of religion, dismissing it as fandom rather than a meaningful spiritual practice. Others see it as emblematic of a broader cultural shift toward individualism and the commodification of spirituality, a symptom of the decline of traditional spiritual institutions. Such criticisms fail to account for the sincerity of adherents of the tradition, who spend months and even years studying the tenets of the religion and ascending the ranks of the Jedi Mastery system.

As those very institutions continue to fail, people will turn to systems that can fulfill those needs previously met by those institutions—spiritual guidance and community that ground them in a system that gives meaning to their lives. Unlike traditional religions, which have revolved around physical community gatherings, Jediism is a product of the internet age, where community—and thus religion—is becoming increasingly virtual.
  
  

## Contemporary Trends: "The Force in the Digital Age"

Jediism is not the only new religion based on fiction, and it likely won't be the last. It stands out from other "fiction-based" or "hyperreal" religions because it has such broad appeal, thanks to being rooted in the Star Wars franchise, which has a significant amount of mythology for adherents to draw from when developing their practices and participating in community discussions aimed at evolving the tradition as a serious religion.

The digital realm has been instrumental in the growth of Jediism—it is unlikely it would have gained nearly the notice it has without the existence of the internet. Members of various Jediism groups gather in forums and Discords to create "virtual congregations," something that other religions could definitely learn from in a rapidly evolving technological age.

With its focus on personal growth and development, Jediism aligns more closely with secular trends than many traditional religions do. The lack of dogmatic demands makes it appealing to secularized people longing for a spiritual tradition that aligns with their individual priorities while still giving them a community of like-minded individuals.

Advancements in technology may offer new ways for Jedi practitioners to engage in their faith. Imagine VR environments where they could engage in meditation, martial training, or group storytelling, all in a setting inspired by the movies themselves. These very same possibilities, however, raise questions about the atomization of spirituality into an individualistic focus over the community focus of many other religions. Additionally, there is the danger of losing connection with reality as everything becomes increasingly virtual.
  

## Conclusion: "A New Hope for Sacred Stories"

Jediism gives us a peek into the evolving nature of spirituality in the modern world,  blurring the boundaries between fiction and faith while challenging traditional definitions of religion. What began as an imaginative construct in the Star Wars universe has since evolved into a growing movement with some legal recognition as a religion in the United States, with members seeking personal growth, ethical guidance, and community that they may have struggled to find elsewhere.

At its core, Jediism reflects the enduring need for myth, ritual, and meaning, even if that meaning comes from "fictional" sources.  With mythology that draws on timeless archetypes and pulls inspiration from a variety of real-world traditions, the philosophical insights within the myths provide a framework that people can build on without it being dogmatic or requiring a rigid belief in it as "true fact".

Jediism offers a new hope for sacred stories.  Myths can be reimagined and recontextualized from any source to meet the spiritual needs of people, and what may look like "fandom" to some can become a source of great spiritual growth and resilience for others.
