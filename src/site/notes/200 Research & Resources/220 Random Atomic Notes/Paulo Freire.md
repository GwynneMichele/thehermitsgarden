### **Paulo Freire (1921–1997)**

Paulo Freire was a Brazilian educator and philosopher best known for his influential work, _[[200 Research & Resources/240 Book Notes/Pedagogy of the Oppressed - Paulo Freire\|Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]_. Born into poverty during the Great Depression, Freire’s experiences shaped his commitment to social justice and education as a means of liberation. His philosophy, known as critical pedagogy, challenges traditional “banking” models of education, which view students as passive recipients of knowledge. Instead, Freire advocated for “problem-posing education,” where students and teachers engage in dialogue, fostering critical consciousness—a deep awareness of societal structures and the power to challenge oppression. Freire’s work emphasizes that education should empower people to become active agents in their own liberation, making his ideas foundational in social justice movements worldwide. His impact endures across disciplines, inspiring educators, activists, and scholars dedicated to transformative learning and societal change.
