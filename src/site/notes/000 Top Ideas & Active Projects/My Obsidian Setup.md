As of January 1, 2025 - when I'm writing this - this is what my Obsidian vault looks like with the daily note open: ![Pasted image 20250101160605.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250101160605.png)
Theme: Blue Topaz with the Pink color pallette
Left sidebar: File folders and Dice Roller plugin
Right sidebar: Calendar and graph

My daily note template uses the CSS.Banners CSS code snippet to add a banner and move the date.  

At the bottom of that daily note, just a scroll down, there's a section that uses the templater plugin to pull in information based on the day of the week for the daily note.
