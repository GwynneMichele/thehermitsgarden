I am not a developer.  I'm a newbie with rusty programming skills.  But I know enough to be dangerous with some AI assistance.

This project plan was drafted by ChatGPT for me to follow to achieve my goal of building a platform where I can create worlds, other people can write stories and create art for them, and we can all be rewarded for it.

Bootstrapping the whole way, I have no budget, but I'll seek grants/retrogrants in the coming months as I make more progress to continue funding development of this.
### **LoreChain Project Plan

#### **Phase 1: Setup & Foundation**
- **Objective**: Establish the basic infrastructure for development and communication with potential users.
- **Current Progress**:
  - ✅ **Development Environment Setup**: 
    - You’ve got your dev environment set up (VS Code, GitHub Desktop, npm, Hardhat, etc.).
    - Testnet ETH is incoming (Base Sepolia testnet via Alchemy).
    - You're set up with Rainbow wallet.
  - ✅ **Placeholder Website**:
    - You have a static "coming soon" page in progress to deploy via Netlify.
    - Styling is underway using basic HTML/CSS with room for visual improvement.
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Finalize and deploy the static webpage on Netlify.
    - Include key messaging about LoreChain: what it is, who you are, and the solo “Learning in Public” journey.

#### **Phase 2: Frontend Development**
- **Objective**: Build the foundation of the LoreChain frontend.
- **Milestones**:
  - **Initial Setup**: 
    - Establish a basic frontend framework (using React or vanilla JavaScript).
    - Install and configure any essential libraries or tools (e.g., ethers.js for wallet integration, API handling).
    - Ensure that the frontend is connected to the Base Sepolia testnet.
  - **User Authentication**:
    - Integrate wallet connection (both MetaMask and Rainbow, as discussed) using ethers.js.
    - Allow basic wallet login/logout functionality.
  - **Simple UI Mockup**:
    - Create a clean, minimal design reflecting the project’s vision.
    - Present users with a basic overview of what they’ll eventually interact with on LoreChain (learning, token exchange, on-chain data, etc.).
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Plan user flow for wallet interaction, ensuring easy onboarding.
    - Design wireframes (if needed) or develop a basic skeleton of the web app.

#### **Phase 3: Smart Contract Integration**
- **Objective**: Create and deploy smart contracts for LoreChain’s core functionality.
- **Milestones**:
  - **Smart Contract Basics**:
    - Develop and test basic smart contracts on the Base Sepolia testnet (e.g., token minting, data storage, or staking).
    - Use Hardhat and Alchemy to deploy contracts.
  - **Test Interactions**:
    - Write scripts to interact with the deployed contracts (read/write functions via ethers.js).
    - Confirm that the frontend can communicate with the smart contracts (wallet reads contract data).
  - **Expand Smart Contract Functionality**:
    - Implement more sophisticated logic based on the vision for LoreChain (e.g., creating NFTs, lore/data storage, tokenomics).
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Sketch out core smart contract logic.
    - Create a roadmap for any additional smart contract features (token minting, staking, etc.).

#### **Phase 4: Content & Community**
- **Objective**: Build interest, explain the project’s vision, and onboard early adopters.
- **Milestones**:
  - **Community Building**:
    - Share your "Learning in Public" journey regularly via Farcaster, Twitter, GitHub, etc.
    - Start a blog or vlog to explain the technical process behind LoreChain.
  - **Content Creation**:
    - Write detailed blog posts explaining the concept of LoreChain (target audience: crypto, web3, and creators).
    - Publish project updates regularly, showing your dev progress.
  - **Project Website Update**:
    - Replace the static "coming soon" page with a more interactive homepage.
    - Showcase LoreChain’s purpose and features.
    - Add a roadmap and mailing list signup for users to stay informed.
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Post frequent project updates on social media.
    - Consider launching a simple community forum or Discord for early feedback.

#### **Phase 5: Testing, Iteration, & Expansion**
- **Objective**: Test the system thoroughly and expand features based on feedback.
- **Milestones**:
  - **Testing**:
    - Conduct thorough tests on smart contracts, frontend, and wallet integration.
    - Get testnet users to try out the system, ensuring proper functionality across multiple wallets.
  - **Feedback Loop**:
    - Iterate based on feedback from community testers and initial users.
    - Add any additional features to smooth out user experience and functionality.
  - **Scale Up**:
    - Once the core system is working, expand on LoreChain’s features (potential integrations with other platforms, more blockchain functions, etc.).
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Set up a list of features to implement post-launch based on user feedback.
    - Continue community engagement with updates, polls, and content.

### **General Timeline**
- **October**:
  - Finish Phase 1 (website deployment and frontend setup).
  - Begin Phase 2 with basic frontend and wallet integration.
- **November**:
  - Continue frontend dev, finish wallet auth, and launch smart contract testing.
  - Begin smart contract integration and testing (Base Sepolia).
- **December**:
  - Iterate based on community feedback and prepare for feature expansion.

### **Additional Notes**
- **Tools to Explore**:
  - **Alchemy**: Already in use for Base Sepolia connection.
  - **Netlify**: For ongoing deployments of the website (it can auto-deploy from GitHub).
  - **VS Code**: You’re using this already for everything. Leverage extensions for React, Hardhat, and ethers.js.
  - **Social/Marketing**: Keep the “Learning in Public” aspect central to engagement.

- **Focus for the Next Few Days**:
  - Finalize the "coming soon" webpage and get it live on Netlify.
  - Plan the wireframe and structure for the actual LoreChain website.
  - Get comfortable with ethers.js, and start playing with the connection to Base Sepolia testnet once the ETH arrives.
