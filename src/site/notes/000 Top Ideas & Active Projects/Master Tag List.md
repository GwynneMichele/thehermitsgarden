A list of all the tags  I'll use in this vault.  (Well, most of them anyway... there's a few strays here and there I'll try to capture that were created before I started implementing this system on [[900 Admin Files/901 Periodic Notes/1 Daily Notes/Friday 10-25-2024\|Friday 10-25-2024]]).

# [[000 Top Ideas & Active Projects/AI Transparency\|AI Transparency]] Tags
I use AI to handle shit that I'm either not great at or that is just tedious to me.  Saves me time and energy so I can focus on what I am good at - learning and writing.

#aidraft  something with the AI Draft tag was drafted by AI.
#humanedited something I drafted with AI, but then edited myself for accuracy or style
#humanwritten something I wrote myself.
#aibrainstorm something I used AI to help with brainstorming.
#aioutline something I used AI to create an outline for.
#aicurriculum something I used AI to draft lesson plans for me to follow.

I use AI to draft self-study curricula and workbooks for myself to use.  I often make those available to other people on a pay-what-you-can basis because they *are* valuable and work does go into creating them, AI just makes it WAY faster to do so.  

I'm a creative writer.  Fiction and non-fiction.  And also in school to finish my philosophy degree, so I write a LOT of stuff where there is no AI involvement - unless I'm using it to brainstorm worldbuilding ideas or create outlines.  I *can* create outlines, but that shit is boring.  I wanna dive into the writing.  But structure helps, so I offload some of that effort.  Except for school stuff depending on the professor's policies. Some are strictly anti-AI, some are okay with using it for outlines and stuff.  But I don't really share my school stuff on my digital garden because I don't want my assignments to get pinged for plagiarism if the checkers pick up my own damn site in a search.
