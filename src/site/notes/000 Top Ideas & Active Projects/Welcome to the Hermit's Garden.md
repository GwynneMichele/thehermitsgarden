hello, hello!

I'm Gwynne, and I am a Curious Hermit.

I want to know *everything*.

And I'll die trying to do just that.

I have arranged my life so that I can devote it to learning.

I've got some big questions about life, the universe, and everything, after all.

This digital garden, written in Obsidian, residing on GitHub, and deployed on Netlify, is me [[Learning in Public\|Learning in Public]].

So, about me:

I am a [[900 Admin Files/990 Old Vaults/The Tome/100 Inboxes/To Sort/Queer Heretic Nun\|Queer Heretic Nun]] and [[Contemplative Sorceress\|Contemplative Sorceress]].  I am founding a monastic order called [[The Order of Paradox\|The Order of Paradox]].

I am a middle-aged woman living in a poor city where I was able to buy a house for $4000 in 2020, so my expenses are low.

I'm a writer and content create.  My content is mostly about my life, though I do offer sessions on occasion, as well as create downloadable digital content - such as useful workbooks for self and biz development, made with AI assistance when I need to work through something myself, and then turned into something others can download at Pay What You Can pricing.

I am a full-time college student.  Went back at the beginning of 2024 to finish the philosophy degree I'd paused two decades ago when my first marriage was falling apart.  I'll graduate around 2026 if I stick to it, which I plan to do, but life hits you like a truck sometimes...

Literally, in my case.  I got hit by a commercial delivery truck in May and broke my leg, spent the summer in bed, and still have a limp and am rebuilding all the lost muscle from two surgeries and 10 weeks of non-weight bearing on that leg.

Right now, the only notes you'll find here are related to my [[600 Deep Dives/DIY MFA Creative Writing/DIY MFA in Creative Writing\|DIY MFA in Creative Writing]] Deep Dive into improving my writing. That starts with [[600 Deep Dives/DIY MFA Creative Writing/Steering the Craft/Steering the Craft\|Steering the Craft]] by Ursula K. Le Guin, and includes a variety of resources and exercises for me to work through over the coming months as I get more serious about my creative writing "career".  (I hate the word career... It's a passion... a driving force.  I HAVE TO WRITE.)

I will be adding ways for readers to interact - need to dig into the various possibilities that will work with using Obsidian+GitHub+Netlify as my hosting solution for this digital garden.  Especially for the DIY MFA project, having feedback will be very useful!

Steal my ideas.  They're all just ideas.  Give credit if you feel moved to.  Toss a [[000 Top Ideas & Active Projects/Support My Work\|tip]] my way if you can.  But what you grow from the seed will be vastly different from what I grow with the seed, so steal away.  Grow what you can.  I've got more where these came from.

<3 Gwynne
