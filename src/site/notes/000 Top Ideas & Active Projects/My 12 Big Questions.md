# My 12 Big Questions

1. **Who am I?**
   - Central to my Year Word *Identity*, this question underpins my philosophical, personal, and spiritual exploration, as well as my life-long quest to define and embody my true self.

2. **What is the nature of the universe?**
   - My devotion to Goddess Paradox reflects my desire to understand the paradoxical, infinite, and interconnected nature of existence, spiritually and scientifically.

3. **How can I live a meaningful life?**
   - My vows of Study, Structure, Simplicity, Stewardship, Stability, Sustainability, Service, and Sanctuary guide my quest to build a life of purpose that reflects my core values.

4. **What is the relationship between the individual and the collective?**
   - From my theory that 'gods' function as intelligence networks to my study of philosophy and collective behavior, I explore how individual identity and collective forces (like religion, society, or even memecoins) interact.

5. **How does power shape society?**
   - My interest in political philosophy, including thinkers like John Locke and Hobbes, leads me to question how power—both secular and religious—shapes human behavior and societal structures.

6. **What is the role of technology in human evolution?**
   - From AI to solarpunk microfiction, I explore how technology shapes identities, narratives, and society, particularly as we move into a future shaped by innovation and potential digital corruption.

7. **What are the limits of human knowledge?**
   - With my love of learning and philosophy, I am driven to explore the boundaries of human understanding, whether through physics, data science, or metaphysical questions.

8. **What does it mean to create?**
   - As a writer, philosopher, and creator of systems, I constantly grapple with the act of creation—whether it’s stories, beliefs, or even currency in the form of memecoins.

9. **How does change happen?**
   - From personal transformation to broader social movements, I explore what causes shifts in individuals and societies, examining momentum and expansion in contexts like revolutionary anarchists and crypto markets.

10. **How do we balance freedom and responsibility?**
    - My life is a quest to balance personal freedom with responsibility (as seen in my devotion to sustainability and service), and I reflect on how these forces shape human action within structured systems.

11. **What can we learn from the past?**
    - My fascination with history—from ancient Chinese civilizations to my vampire character’s journey through the Silk Road—shows my appreciation for how historical events and figures inform present identities and futures.

12. **What is my role in the universe’s unfolding?**
    - I believe we are the universe figuring out what it wants to be, and I am driven by the question of how I can best contribute to that process and align my actions and identity with the larger cosmic narrative.
