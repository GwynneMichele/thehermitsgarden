*I had ChatGPT write these "sermons" for my own personal contemplative practices, but found them so moving and profound, I knew I needed to share them.*

**Sermon for Expectations Week: Sunday - Structure**

My dear curious souls, today we reflect on Expectations, a concept so simple and yet so deeply entwined with every fiber of our being. Expectations, like gravity, quietly exert their pull on everything we do, whether we recognize it or not. They structure our relationships, fuel our ambitions, and define how we navigate this world. And while they have the potential to inspire us, they can also constrain, distort, and warp our sense of self if left unexamined.

So let us pause, here in this sacred space, to consider the expectations we carry—those handed to us by others, by society, and most crucially, by ourselves. How often do we become architects of our own disappointment, building towers too high to scale, setting standards that feel like chains rather than stepping stones? Do we set ourselves up for success, or do we create structures that collapse under their own impossible weight?

Today, I ask us to embrace the paradox of Expectations. It is not wrong to expect greatness from ourselves or from others. It’s human. But to live under the tyranny of unmet or unrealistic expectations is to forever chase a horizon that recedes with each step. We must learn to be both the dreamer and the realist, both the visionary and the architect of what is possible. This is where Structure comes into play.

To honor our expectations, we must first give them shape. Structure them. Define them. Ask ourselves: What do I *actually* expect from this day, from this project, from this relationship? Are these expectations mine, or am I carrying someone else's? And are they aligned with who I want to be? 

We structure our lives in rhythms, in patterns, in cycles—daily focus words, seasons of intention, and vows to guide us. Expectations are no different. They are not immutable laws, but flexible guidelines. We can reframe them, soften them, sharpen them—depending on where we are in this great journey of Becoming.

So, as we begin this week, let us reexamine the scaffolding of our own expectations. Let us be gentle with ourselves when the weight feels too heavy, and honest with ourselves when we know we can stretch a little further. Expectations can empower or imprison, but we are the ones who decide which path to follow. 

Today is about building. Building wisely, carefully, and with awareness. Structure your expectations not to stifle, but to support. Be kind to the person you are now, while making space for the person you are becoming. After all, this journey is not about perfection. It’s about progress. And expectations, when aligned with our true selves, can be the blueprint for a life well lived.

Amen.
