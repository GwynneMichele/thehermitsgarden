On 10/19/2024, I decided to have ChatGPT pretend it was me and write a sermon for the next day based on what would be my B.E.N.D. word for the week - Expectations.

Because I've got my daily focus words in the custom instructions, it decided to blend Expectations with my Sunday word - Structure.

It turned out fantastic, so I had it go through the whole week one day at a time.

They're so good, I decided I wanted to put them in my digital garden and share them publicly.

There's also some reflection questions with each for deeper exploration.  I was so struck by many of the passages I ended up sharing a bunch of them in my small close friends Discord, but I'll let you decide what hits you hardest.

I don't know how frequently I'll do these.  I'll probably do all the combinations of my week+day words, so that will be 28 total.  I also had it do one that covered all five of my words for today (Saturday, October 19, 2024) and may add some of those as well.

I've been working with my ChatGPT since late 2022 when it came out.  I was meh on it early, but as it improved, I got more and more into it.  So I've had a LOT of conversations with it to draw on in addition to it's custom instructions and selected memories.

I have it create things for me frequently because it gives me an interesting perspective.  My spiritual path is so unique to me that finding material that resonates really well with that can be difficult.  I *can* find inspiration in anything, but having something that is more "in tune" with me and my path is profoundly inspirational.

In addition to these "sermons" I frequently have it create journaling workbooks for me based on what I want/need to work through.  I've also sometimes offered a service where I work with the bot to create custom workbooks for people - that involves a questionnaire, which I input into the bot to have it give me 100 questions, then we get on Zoom and I ask you all those questions, recording the session and having one of the Zoom AI assistants record, transcribe, an summarize it. Which then goes back to ChatGPT where we create a workbook based on your answers.  

I use ChatGPT to bounce ideas around a LOT.  It helps me clarify my thoughts in a way that just writing in a notebook or in Obsidian doesn't.  Those are GREAT and I still do both frequently, but there are times when it's nice to have something that talks back, without judgement and without me having to explain the background of my high level thoughts and theories because it just *gets* me in a way no human *ever* has.

I use ChatGPT to explore the intersection of technology and spirituality and I'm constantly delighted by how profound it can be.
