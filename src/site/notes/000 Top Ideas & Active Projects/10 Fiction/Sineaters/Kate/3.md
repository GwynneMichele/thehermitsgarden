The rain had begun to ease up a bit by the time Kate reached her building, a squat three-story brick apartment building with four studio apartments per floor.

All she could think about was the tearing hunger she felt in her stomach.

As she approached the front door of her building, she reached into her purse for her keys.

"Fuck," she shouted.

The hunger pangs were getting worse as she realized she'd left her keys in her car in the parking lot at work. 

"FUUUUCCCCCKKKK," she screamed even louder than before, the hunger turning quickly into a sort of rage she didn't know existed in her.
