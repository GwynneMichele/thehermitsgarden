It hadn't been raining when she left work.  That mess had only started when she was already halfway home.  Not that her day had been going well.  She was only walking home because her car wouldn't start, Kyle wasn't answering his phone, and she didn't have roadside assistance, so rather than sit and wait for her brother to pick up, she decided to walk home because tomorrow was payday so she didn't even have the money for a tow.  The rain was just the cherry on top of an already fucked day.

Kate didn't see the old man until he was already in front of her, his hand reaching out in the rain for her face.  She was so shocked, she froze, and then felt a jolt of electricity as his hand touched her face.  She jerked away just as he collapsed in front of her.

"Don't tell them," he said, and then his body crumbled into dust.
