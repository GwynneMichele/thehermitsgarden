The greasy smell of Tony's Diner hit Kate's nose, and she turned quickly in that direction.

She had a tab there.  She could order whatever she wanted.  A burger and fries.  Some chicken tenders.  And one of those dry ass chocolate cakes Tony was so proud of.  She didn't care what it tasted like, she just wanted to eat.

As she walked, she thought about who might be working.  Tony would probably be there, his flashy car parked right in front.  On a Friday night, it was probably Jones in the kitchen with some new kid they'd hired to replace the last kid because Jones was such a prick.

He made good burgers though.
